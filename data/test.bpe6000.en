Se@@ ver@@ al years ago here at TED , P@@ eter Sk@@ ill@@ man intro@@ duc@@ ed a design challenge called the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge .
And the idea &apos;s pretty simple : Te@@ ams of four have to build the t@@ all@@ est fre@@ e-@@ standing structure out of 20 sti@@ cks of sp@@ a@@ gh@@ ett@@ i , one y@@ ard of t@@ ape , one y@@ ard of str@@ ing and a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low .
The mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low has to be on top .
And , though it seems really simple , it &apos;s actually pretty hard because it for@@ ces people to coll@@ abor@@ ate very quickly .
And so , I thought this was an interesting idea , and I in@@ cor@@ por@@ ated it into a design wor@@ k@@ sho@@ p .
And it was a huge success .
And since then , I &apos;ve con@@ duc@@ ted about 70 design wor@@ k@@ sh@@ op@@ s across the world with students and designers and archit@@ ects , even the C@@ T@@ O@@ s of the For@@ t@@ une 50 , and there &apos;s something about this ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise that re@@ ve@@ als very deep less@@ ons about the nature of coll@@ abor@@ ation , and I &apos;d like to share some of them with you .
So , norm@@ ally , most people begin by ori@@ ent@@ ing themselves to the t@@ ask .
They talk about it , they figure out what it &apos;s going to look like , they jo@@ ck@@ ey for power .
Then they spend some time plan@@ ning , organi@@ zing , they sk@@ et@@ ch and they l@@ ay out sp@@ a@@ gh@@ ett@@ i .
They spend the maj@@ ority of their time ass@@ em@@ bl@@ ing the sti@@ cks into e@@ ver@@ -@@ growing struc@@ tures .
And then finally , just as they &apos;re running out of time , someone takes out the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and then they g@@ ing@@ er@@ ly put it on top , and then they stand back , and -- ta@@ -@@ da ! -- they ad@@ m@@ ire their work .
But what really happens , most of the time , is that the &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; turns into an &quot; u@@ h@@ -@@ oh , &quot; because the wei@@ ght of the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low caus@@ es the entire structure to bu@@ ck@@ le and to coll@@ ap@@ se .
So there are a number of people who have a lot more &quot; u@@ h@@ -@@ oh &quot; mom@@ ents than others , and am@@ ong the wor@@ st are rec@@ ent gradu@@ ates of business school .
They l@@ ie , they che@@ at , they get dis@@ tra@@ c@@ ted and they produce really l@@ ame struc@@ tures .
And of course there are te@@ ams that have a lot more &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; struc@@ tures , and am@@ ong the best are rec@@ ent gradu@@ ates of kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten .
And it &apos;s pretty amazing .
As P@@ eter tells us , not only do they produce the t@@ all@@ est struc@@ tures , but they &apos;re the most interesting struc@@ tures of them all .
So the question you want to ask is : How come ? Why ? What is it about them ?
And P@@ eter li@@ kes to say that n@@ one of the kids spend any time trying to be C@@ E@@ O of Spa@@ gh@@ ett@@ i , In@@ c . Right ?
They don &apos;t spend time jo@@ ck@@ e@@ ying for power .
But there &apos;s another reason as well .
And the reason is that business students are tra@@ ined to find the single right plan , right ?
And then they ex@@ ec@@ ute on it .
And then what happens is , when they put the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on the top , they run out of time and what happens ?
It &apos;s a crisis .
So@@ und famili@@ ar ? Right .
What kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten@@ ers do differ@@ ently is that they start with the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , and they build prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ es , suc@@ c@@ es@@ sive prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ es , always ke@@ ep@@ ing the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low on top , so they have multi@@ ple times to fi@@ x when they build prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ es along the way .
Desig@@ ners recogni@@ ze this type of coll@@ abor@@ ation as the ess@@ ence of the it@@ er@@ ative process .
And with each version , kids get inst@@ ant fe@@ ed@@ back about what works and what doesn &apos;t work .
So the cap@@ ac@@ ity to play in prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e is really ess@@ ential , but let &apos;s look at how different te@@ ams per@@ form .
So the average for most people is around 20 in@@ ches ; business schools students , about half of that ; la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , a little better , but not much better than that , kin@@ der@@ gar@@ ten@@ ers , better than most ad@@ ults .
Who does the very best ?
Archit@@ ects and engine@@ ers , th@@ an@@ k@@ fully .
Th@@ ir@@ t@@ y-@@ nine in@@ ches is the t@@ all@@ est structure I &apos;ve seen .
And why is it ? Because they understand tri@@ an@@ gl@@ es and self-@@ r@@ ein@@ for@@ cing ge@@ omet@@ ri@@ cal patterns are the key to building st@@ able struc@@ tures .
So C@@ E@@ O@@ s , a little bit better than average , but here &apos;s where it gets interesting .
If you put you put an ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive ad@@ min@@ . on the team , they get signific@@ antly better .
It &apos;s incredible . You know , you look around , you go , &quot; Oh , that team &apos;s going to win . &quot;
You can just tell be@@ for@@ eh@@ and . And why is that ?
Because they have special sk@@ ills of fac@@ ili@@ tation .
They man@@ age the process , they understand the process .
And any team who man@@ ages and pa@@ ys close attention to work will signific@@ antly impro@@ ve the team &apos;s per@@ forman@@ ce .
Sp@@ ec@@ i@@ alized sk@@ ills and fac@@ ili@@ tation sk@@ ills are the com@@ bin@@ ation that lea@@ ds to strong success .
If you have 10 te@@ ams that ty@@ pic@@ ally per@@ form , you &apos;ll get maybe six or so that have standing struc@@ tures .
And I tried something interesting .
I thought , let &apos;s up the an@@ te , once .
So I off@@ er@@ ed a 10@@ ,000 d@@ ollar pri@@ ze of software to the w@@ inning team .
So what do you think happened to these design students ?
What was the result ?
Here &apos;s what happened : Not one team had a standing structure .
If anyone had built , say , a one in@@ ch structure , they would have taken home the pri@@ ze .
So , isn &apos;t that interesting ? That high st@@ ak@@ es have a strong impact .
We did the ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise again with the same students .
What do you think happened then ?
So now they understand the value of prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ ing .
So the same team went from being the very wor@@ st to being am@@ ong the very best .
They produc@@ ed the t@@ all@@ est struc@@ tures in the least amount of time .
So there &apos;s deep less@@ ons for us about the nature of inc@@ enti@@ ves and success .
So , you might ask : Why would anyone actually spend time writing a mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge ?
And the reason is , I help create digital tools and process@@ es to help te@@ ams build cars and video games and visual eff@@ ects .
And what the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low challenge does is it hel@@ ps them identi@@ fy the hi@@ d@@ den as@@ su@@ mp@@ tions .
Because , f@@ rank@@ ly , every project has its own mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low , doesn &apos;t it ?
The challenge provi@@ des a shar@@ ed experience , a common language , a common st@@ ance to build the right prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e .
And so , this is the value of the experience , of this so simple ex@@ er@@ c@@ ise .
And those of you who are interested may want to go to Mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ low@@ Ch@@ allen@@ ge@@ .@@ co@@ m .
It &apos;s a blo@@ g that you can look at how to build the mar@@ sh@@ mal@@ lo@@ ws .
There &apos;s st@@ ep@@ -@@ b@@ y-@@ step in@@ struc@@ tions on this .
There are cra@@ zy examples from around the world of how people t@@ we@@ ak and ad@@ just the system .
There &apos;s world rec@@ or@@ ds that are on this as well .
And the fundamental less@@ on , I believe , is that design tru@@ ly is a cont@@ act sp@@ ort .
It dem@@ ands that we bring all of our sen@@ ses to the t@@ ask , and that we app@@ ly the very best of our thinking , our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand .
And sometimes , a little prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an &quot; u@@ h@@ -@@ oh &quot; moment to a &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; moment .
And that can make a big difference .
Thank you very much .
Let &apos;s pre@@ tend right here we have a machine .
A big machine , a cool , TED@@ -@@ ish machine , and it &apos;s a time machine .
And everyone in this room has to get into it .
And you can go back@@ wards , you can go for@@ wards ; you cannot stay where you are .
And I w@@ on@@ der what you &apos;d cho@@ ose , because I &apos;ve been asking my friends this question a lot l@@ ately and they all want to go back .
I don &apos;t know . They want to go back before there were autom@@ ob@@ il@@ es or T@@ wit@@ ter or &quot; American I@@ do@@ l . &quot;
I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m conv@@ inc@@ ed that there &apos;s some sort of p@@ ull to n@@ os@@ tal@@ gi@@ a , to wis@@ h@@ ful thinking .
And I understand that .
I &apos;m not part of that cro@@ w@@ d , I have to say .
I don &apos;t want to go back , and it &apos;s not because I &apos;m ad@@ vent@@ ur@@ ous .
It &apos;s because possi@@ bili@@ ties on this planet , they don &apos;t go back , they go forward .
So I want to get in the machine , and I want to go forward .
This is the great@@ est time there &apos;s ever been on this planet by any measure that you wish to cho@@ ose : health , we@@ al@@ th , mo@@ bility , opportunity , dec@@ lin@@ ing r@@ ates of disease ...
There &apos;s never been a time like this .
My great@@ -@@ grand@@ parents died , all of them , by the time they were 60 .
My grand@@ parents p@@ ush@@ ed that number to 70 .
My parents are clos@@ ing in on 80 .
So there better be a nine at the beginning of my death number .
But it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a bigger deal than that .
A kid born in New Del@@ h@@ i today can expect to live as long as the ri@@ ch@@ est man in the world did 100 years ago .
Th@@ ink about that , it &apos;s an incredible fact .
And why is it true ?
S@@ m@@ all@@ po@@ x . S@@ m@@ all@@ po@@ x kill@@ ed billi@@ ons of people on this planet .
It res@@ h@@ ap@@ ed the dem@@ ograp@@ hy of the g@@ lo@@ be in a way that no war ever has .
It &apos;s gone . It &apos;s van@@ ished .
We van@@ qu@@ ished it . P@@ u@@ ff .
In the rich world , dis@@ eas@@ es that thre@@ aten@@ ed millions of us just a generation ago no longer ex@@ ist , har@@ dly .
Di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ a , ru@@ b@@ ell@@ a , poli@@ o ...
does anyone even know what those things are ?
V@@ acc@@ ines , modern medic@@ ine , our ability to fe@@ ed billi@@ ons of people , those are tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s of the scientific me@@ th@@ od .
And to my mind , the scientific me@@ th@@ od -- trying stuff out , seeing if it works , changing it when it doesn &apos;t -- is one of the great ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ ments of human@@ ity .
So that &apos;s the good news .
Un@@ fortun@@ ately , that &apos;s all the good news because there are some other problems , and they &apos;ve been men@@ tion@@ ed many times .
And one of them is that des@@ pi@@ te all our ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ ments , a billion people go to bed h@@ un@@ gr@@ y in this world every day .
That number &apos;s ris@@ ing , and it &apos;s ris@@ ing really rap@@ i@@ dly , and it &apos;s dis@@ gra@@ ce@@ ful .
And not only that , we &apos;ve used our imag@@ in@@ ation to th@@ or@@ ough@@ ly tr@@ ash this g@@ lo@@ be .
Pot@@ able water , ar@@ able land , ra@@ in@@ for@@ ests , oil , gas : they &apos;re going away , and they &apos;re going away soon , and un@@ less we innov@@ ate our way out of this m@@ ess , we &apos;re going away too .
So the question is : Can we do that ? And I think we can .
I think it &apos;s clear that we can make food that will fe@@ ed billi@@ ons of people without rap@@ ing the land that they live on .
I think we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t also des@@ tro@@ y it .
I really do believe that , and , no , it ain &apos;t wis@@ h@@ ful thinking .
But here &apos;s the thing that ke@@ ep@@ s me up at night -- one of the things that ke@@ ep@@ s me up at night : We &apos;ve never needed pro@@ gress in science more than we need it right now . N@@ ever .
And we &apos;ve also never been in a position to dep@@ lo@@ y it proper@@ ly in the way that we can today .
We &apos;re on the ver@@ ge of amazing , amazing ev@@ ents in many fi@@ el@@ ds , and yet I actually think we &apos;d have to go back hundreds , 300 years , before the En@@ ligh@@ ten@@ ment , to find a time when we b@@ att@@ led pro@@ gress , when we f@@ ought about these things more vi@@ g@@ or@@ ously , on more fron@@ ts , than we do now .
People w@@ ra@@ p themselves in their belie@@ f@@ s , and they do it so ti@@ gh@@ tly that you can &apos;t set them free .
Not even the truth will set them free .
And , listen , everyone &apos;s enti@@ t@@ led to their op@@ ini@@ on ; they &apos;re even enti@@ t@@ led to their op@@ ini@@ on about pro@@ gress .
But you know what you &apos;re not enti@@ t@@ led to ?
You &apos;re not enti@@ t@@ led to your own fac@@ ts . Sor@@ ry , you &apos;re not .
And this took me a@@ while to figure out .
Ab@@ out a dec@@ ade ago , I wrote a story about v@@ acc@@ ines for The New Yor@@ ker . A little story .
And I was ama@@ zed to find op@@ position : op@@ position to what is , after all , the most effec@@ tive public health measure in human history .
I didn &apos;t know what to do , so I just did what I do : I wrote a story and I moved on .
And soon after that , I wrote a story about gene@@ tically engine@@ er@@ ed food .
S@@ ame thing , only bigger .
People were going cra@@ zy .
So I wrote a story about that too , and I couldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; Fran@@ ken@@ fo@@ o@@ ds , &quot; why they thought moving molec@@ ules around in a speci@@ fic , rather than a h@@ ap@@ ha@@ z@@ ard way , was tr@@ es@@ pass@@ ing on nature &apos;s ground .
But , you know , I do what I do . I wrote the story , I moved on .
I mean , I &apos;m a jour@@ n@@ alist .
We type , we fi@@ le , we go to d@@ inner . It &apos;s fine .
But these stories bo@@ ther@@ ed me , and I couldn &apos;t figure out why , and eventually I did .
And that &apos;s because those fan@@ ati@@ cs that were dri@@ ving me cra@@ zy weren &apos;t actually fan@@ ati@@ cs at all .
They were thou@@ gh@@ t@@ ful people , educ@@ ated people , dec@@ ent people .
They were exactly like the people in this room .
And it just dis@@ tur@@ bed me so much .
But then I thought , you know , let &apos;s be hon@@ est .
We &apos;re at a point in this world where we don &apos;t have the same relationship to pro@@ gress that we used to .
We talk about it am@@ bi@@ val@@ ently .
We talk about it in ir@@ on@@ ic terms with little quot@@ es around it : &quot; pro@@ gress . &quot;
Okay , there are reasons for that , and I think we know what those reasons are .
We &apos;ve lost fa@@ it@@ h in institu@@ tions , in auth@@ ority , and sometimes in science itself , and there &apos;s no reason we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t have .
You can just say a few nam@@ es and people will understand .
C@@ her@@ no@@ b@@ y@@ l , B@@ hop@@ al , the Ch@@ allen@@ ger , Vi@@ ox@@ x , we@@ ap@@ ons of mass des@@ tru@@ ction , han@@ ging cha@@ ds .
You know , you can cho@@ ose your list .
There are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right , so be sk@@ ep@@ tical .
As@@ k questions , dem@@ and pro@@ of , dem@@ and evidence .
Don &apos;t take anything for gr@@ an@@ ted .
But here &apos;s the thing : When you get pro@@ of , you need to ac@@ cept the pro@@ of , and we &apos;re not that good at doing that .
And the reason that I can say that is because we &apos;re now in an epi@@ demic of fe@@ ar like one I &apos;ve never seen and hope never to see again .
Ab@@ out 12 years ago , there was a story publi@@ shed , a hor@@ ri@@ ble story , that lin@@ ked the epi@@ demic of au@@ tis@@ m to the meas@@ les , m@@ um@@ ps and ru@@ b@@ ell@@ a v@@ acc@@ ine sho@@ t .
Ver@@ y sc@@ ary .
T@@ ons of stu@@ dies were done to see if this was true .
T@@ ons of stu@@ dies should have been done ; it &apos;s a serious issue .
The data came back .
The data came back from the United States , from England , from S@@ we@@ den , from Can@@ ad@@ a , and it was all the same : no cor@@ rel@@ ation , no connec@@ tion , n@@ one at all .
It doesn &apos;t matter . It doesn &apos;t matter because we believe an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ es , we believe what we see , what we think we see , what makes us feel real .
We don &apos;t believe a bunch of doc@@ um@@ ents from a government off@@ ici@@ al giving us data , and I do understand that , I think we all do .
But you know what ?
The result of that has been dis@@ a@@ str@@ ous .
Dis@@ a@@ str@@ ous because here &apos;s a fact : The United States is one of the only countries in the world where the v@@ acc@@ ine rate for meas@@ les is going down .
That is dis@@ gra@@ ce@@ ful , and we should be ash@@ am@@ ed of ourselves .
It &apos;s hor@@ ri@@ ble .
What kind of a thing happened that we could do that ?
Now , I understand it . I do understand it .
Because , did anyone have meas@@ les here ?
H@@ as one person in this audience ever seen someone die of meas@@ les ?
Do@@ esn &apos;t happen very much .
Do@@ esn &apos;t happen in this country at all , but it happened 1@@ 6@@ 0,000 times in the world last year .
That &apos;s a lot of death of meas@@ les -- 20 an hour .
But since it didn &apos;t happen here , we can put it out of our minds , and people like J@@ enn@@ y Mc@@ Car@@ thy can go around pre@@ ach@@ ing mes@@ sa@@ ges of fe@@ ar and illi@@ ter@@ ac@@ y from plat@@ forms like &quot; O@@ pra@@ h &quot; and &quot; Lar@@ ry K@@ ing Li@@ ve . &quot;
And they can do it because they don &apos;t lin@@ k c@@ au@@ sation and cor@@ rel@@ ation .
They don &apos;t understand that these things seem the same , but they &apos;re almost never the same .
And it &apos;s something we need to learn , and we need to learn it really soon .
This guy was a her@@ o , J@@ on@@ as S@@ alk .
He took one of the wor@@ st sc@@ our@@ ges of man@@ kind away from us .
No fe@@ ar , no ag@@ ony . Poli@@ o -- pu@@ ff , gone .
That guy in the middle , not so much .
H@@ is name is Paul O@@ ff@@ it .
He just developed a rot@@ avi@@ r@@ us v@@ acc@@ ine with a bunch of other people .
It &apos;ll save the lives of 400 to 5@@ 00@@ ,000 kids in the developing world every year .
P@@ re@@ tty good , right ?
Well , it &apos;s good , except that Paul goes around talking about v@@ acc@@ ines and says how val@@ u@@ able they are and that people ought to just stop the wh@@ ining .
And he actually says it that way .
So , Paul &apos;s a ter@@ r@@ or@@ ist .
When Paul spe@@ a@@ ks in a public hear@@ ing , he can &apos;t tes@@ ti@@ fy without ar@@ m@@ ed gu@@ ards .
He gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school .
And why ? Because Paul made a v@@ acc@@ ine .
I don &apos;t need to say this , but v@@ acc@@ ines are ess@@ ential .
You take them away , disease comes back , hor@@ ri@@ ble dis@@ eas@@ es . And that &apos;s happening .
We have meas@@ les in this country now .
And it &apos;s getting wor@@ se , and pretty soon kids are going to die of it again because it &apos;s just a numbers game .
And they &apos;re not just going to die of meas@@ les .
What about poli@@ o ? Let &apos;s have that . Why not ?
A col@@ lege cl@@ ass@@ mate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said she thought I was a little stri@@ dent .
No one &apos;s ever said that before .
She wasn &apos;t going to v@@ acc@@ in@@ ate her kid against poli@@ o , no way .
F@@ ine .
Why ? Because we don &apos;t have poli@@ o . And you know what ?
We didn &apos;t have poli@@ o in this country y@@ es@@ ter@@ day .
To@@ day , I don &apos;t know , maybe a guy got on a plane in La@@ go@@ s this morning , and he &apos;s fl@@ ying to L@@ A@@ X , right now he &apos;s over O@@ hi@@ o .
And he &apos;s going to land in a couple of hours , he &apos;s going to r@@ ent a car , and he &apos;s going to come to L@@ ong Be@@ ach , and he &apos;s going to att@@ end one of these f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous TED d@@ inn@@ ers ton@@ ight .
And he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s inf@@ ected with a par@@ aly@@ tic disease , and we don &apos;t either because that &apos;s the way the world works .
That &apos;s the planet we live on . Don &apos;t pre@@ tend it isn &apos;t .
Now , we love to w@@ ra@@ p ourselves in lies . We love to do it .
Every@@ one take their v@@ it@@ am@@ ins this morning ?
E@@ ch@@ in@@ ac@@ e@@ a , a little anti@@ ox@@ i@@ d@@ ant to get you going .
I know you did because half of Americ@@ ans do every day .
They take the stuff , and they take altern@@ ative medic@@ ines , and it doesn &apos;t matter how often we find out that they &apos;re us@@ eless .
The data says it all the time .
They dar@@ ken your ur@@ ine . They almost never do more than that .
It &apos;s okay , you want to pay 2@@ 8 billion dollars for dark ur@@ ine ?
I &apos;m totally with you .
Dar@@ k ur@@ ine . Dar@@ k .
Why do we do that ? Why do we do that ?
Well , I think I understand , we ha@@ te Bi@@ g P@@ har@@ ma .
We ha@@ te Bi@@ g Go@@ vern@@ ment . We don &apos;t tr@@ ust the Man .
And we sh@@ ouldn &apos;t : Our health care system su@@ cks .
It &apos;s c@@ ru@@ el to millions of people .
It &apos;s absolutely ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ingly c@@ old and sou@@ l@@ -@@ ben@@ ding to those of us who can even aff@@ ord it .
So we run away from it , and where do we run ?
We lea@@ p into the ar@@ ms of Bi@@ g Pl@@ ac@@ e@@ b@@ o .
That &apos;s fantas@@ tic . I love Bi@@ g Pl@@ ac@@ e@@ b@@ o .
But , you know , it &apos;s really a serious thing because this stuff is cra@@ p , and we spend billi@@ ons of dollars on it .
And I have all sorts of little pro@@ ps here .
N@@ one of it ... gin@@ k@@ go , fr@@ au@@ d ; e@@ ch@@ in@@ ac@@ e@@ a , fr@@ au@@ d ; ac@@ a@@ i -- I don &apos;t even know what that is but we &apos;re sp@@ ending billi@@ ons of dollars on it -- it &apos;s fr@@ au@@ d .
And you know what ? When I say this stuff , people scre@@ am at me , and they say , &quot; What do you care ? Let people do what they want to do .
It makes them feel good . &quot;
And you know what ? You &apos;re wrong .
Because I don &apos;t care if it &apos;s the sec@@ ret@@ ary of H@@ H@@ S who &apos;s saying , &quot; H@@ mm , I &apos;m not going to take the evidence of my exper@@ ts on ma@@ mm@@ ogra@@ ms , &quot; or some cancer qu@@ ack who wants to tre@@ at his patient with co@@ ff@@ ee en@@ em@@ as .
When you start down the road where belie@@ f and ma@@ gic re@@ place evidence and science , you end up in a place you don &apos;t want to be .
You end up in Th@@ ab@@ o M@@ be@@ k@@ i South Africa .
He kill@@ ed 4@@ 00@@ ,000 of his people by ins@@ is@@ ting that be@@ et@@ ro@@ ot , gar@@ li@@ c and le@@ m@@ on oil were much more effec@@ tive than the anti@@ re@@ tro@@ vi@@ ral dru@@ gs we know can s@@ low the course of AIDS .
H@@ und@@ re@@ ds of thousands of nee@@ d@@ less de@@ a@@ ths in a country that has been pl@@ ag@@ u@@ ed wor@@ se than any other by this disease .
P@@ le@@ ase , don &apos;t tell me there are no con@@ sequ@@ ences to these things .
There are . There always are .
Now , the most min@@ d@@ less epi@@ demic we &apos;re in the middle of right now is this ab@@ sur@@ d b@@ att@@ le between pro@@ pon@@ ents of gene@@ tically engine@@ er@@ ed food and the organ@@ ic eli@@ te .
It &apos;s an i@@ di@@ o@@ tic de@@ b@@ ate . It has to stop .
It &apos;s a de@@ b@@ ate about words , about metap@@ h@@ ors .
It &apos;s ide@@ ology , it &apos;s not science .
Every single thing we eat , every gra@@ in of ri@@ ce , every sp@@ ri@@ g of par@@ s@@ ley , every Br@@ us@@ sel@@ s spr@@ out has been mo@@ di@@ fied by man .
You know , there weren &apos;t tan@@ ger@@ ines in the gar@@ den of E@@ den .
There wasn &apos;t any can@@ tal@@ ou@@ p@@ e . There weren &apos;t Chr@@ ist@@ m@@ as trees . We made it all .
We made it over the last 1@@ 1@@ ,000 years .
And some of it worked , and some of it didn &apos;t .
We got ri@@ d of the stuff that didn &apos;t .
Now we can do it in a more pre@@ c@@ ise way -- and there are ris@@ ks , absolutely -- but we can put something like v@@ it@@ am@@ in A into ri@@ ce , and that stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , pro@@ long their lives .
You don &apos;t want to do that ?
I have to say , I don &apos;t understand it .
We object to gene@@ tically engine@@ er@@ ed food .
Why do we do that ?
Well , the things I con@@ st@@ antly hear are : To@@ o many chem@@ ic@@ als , p@@ esti@@ ci@@ des , hor@@ mon@@ es , mon@@ o@@ culture , we don &apos;t want gi@@ ant fi@@ el@@ ds of the same thing , that &apos;s wrong .
We don &apos;t companies pat@@ ent@@ ing life .
We don &apos;t want companies ow@@ ning se@@ e@@ ds .
And you know what my response to all of that is ?
Yes , you &apos;re right . Let &apos;s fi@@ x it .
It &apos;s true , we &apos;ve got a huge food problem , but this isn &apos;t science .
This has nothing to do with science .
It &apos;s law , it &apos;s mor@@ ality , it &apos;s pat@@ ent stuff .
You know science isn &apos;t a company .
It &apos;s not a country .
It &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a process .
It &apos;s a process , and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn &apos;t , but the idea that we should not allow science to do its job because we &apos;re a@@ fra@@ id , is really very de@@ a@@ den@@ ing , and it &apos;s pre@@ vent@@ ing millions of people from pr@@ os@@ per@@ ing .
You know , in the next 50 years we &apos;re going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we do right now , 70 percent .
This inv@@ est@@ ment in Africa over the last 30 years .
Dis@@ gra@@ ce@@ ful . Dis@@ gra@@ ce@@ ful .
They need it , and we &apos;re not giving it to them .
And why ? Gen@@ e@@ tically engine@@ er@@ ed food .
We don &apos;t want to en@@ coura@@ ge people to eat that rot@@ ten stuff , like c@@ as@@ sa@@ v@@ a for inst@@ ance .
C@@ as@@ sa@@ v@@ a &apos;s something that half a billion people eat .
It &apos;s kind of like a pot@@ a@@ to .
It &apos;s just a bunch of cal@@ ories . It su@@ cks .
It doesn &apos;t have n@@ ut@@ ri@@ ents , it doesn &apos;t have prot@@ ein , and scientists are engine@@ ering all of that into it right now .
And then people would be able to eat it and they &apos;d be able to not go bl@@ ind .
They wouldn &apos;t star@@ ve , and you know what ?
That would be nice . It wouldn &apos;t be C@@ he@@ z Pan@@ is@@ se , but it would be nice .
And all I can say about this is : Why are we fi@@ gh@@ ting it ?
I mean , let &apos;s ask ourselves : Why are we fi@@ gh@@ ting it ?
Because we don &apos;t want to move gen@@ es around ?
This is about moving gen@@ es around . It &apos;s not about chem@@ ic@@ als .
It &apos;s not about our ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous passi@@ on for hor@@ mon@@ es , our ins@@ ist@@ ence on having bigger food , better food , sing@@ ular food .
This isn &apos;t about Ri@@ ce K@@ ris@@ pi@@ es , this is about ke@@ ep@@ ing people alive , and it &apos;s about time we started to understand what that me@@ ant .
Because , you know something ?
If we don &apos;t , if we continue to act the way we &apos;re ac@@ ting , we &apos;re gu@@ il@@ ty of something that I don &apos;t think we want to be gu@@ il@@ ty of : high-@@ te@@ ch col@@ oni@@ alis@@ m .
There &apos;s no other way to descri@@ be what &apos;s going on here .
It &apos;s sel@@ fish , it &apos;s u@@ g@@ ly , it &apos;s ben@@ e@@ ath us , and we really have to stop it .
So after this ama@@ z@@ ingly fun conver@@ sation , you might want to say , &quot; So , you still want to get in this ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous time machine and go forward ? &quot;
Ab@@ sol@@ utely . Ab@@ sol@@ utely , I do .
It &apos;s stu@@ ck in the present right now , but we have an amazing opportunity .
We can set that time machine on anything we want .
We can move it where we want to move it , and we &apos;re going to move it where we want to move it .
We have to have these conver@@ sa@@ tions and we have to think , but when we get in the time machine and we go ah@@ ead , we &apos;re going to be happy we do .
I know that we can , and as far as I &apos;m con@@ cer@@ ned , that &apos;s something the world needs right now .
Thank you .
One day , L@@ os An@@ gel@@ es Times col@@ um@@ n@@ ist Ste@@ ve L@@ op@@ e@@ z was walking along the stre@@ ets of do@@ wn@@ town L@@ os An@@ gel@@ es when he heard beautiful music .
And the source was a man , an Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American man , char@@ ming , ru@@ g@@ ged , hom@@ eless , playing a vi@@ o@@ lin that only had two str@@ ings .
And I &apos;m telling a story that many of you know , because Ste@@ ve &apos;s col@@ um@@ ns became the bas@@ is for a book , which was turned into a movie , with Ro@@ bert Do@@ w@@ ney J@@ r. ac@@ ting as Ste@@ ve L@@ op@@ e@@ z , and J@@ am@@ ie Fo@@ x@@ x as Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el An@@ th@@ ony A@@ y@@ ers , the Ju@@ illi@@ ar@@ d-@@ tra@@ ined dou@@ ble b@@ ass@@ ist wh@@ ose promis@@ ing car@@ e@@ er was cut short by a tra@@ gic aff@@ lic@@ tion with par@@ an@@ o@@ id schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ia .
Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el dro@@ pped out of Ju@@ illi@@ ard , he suff@@ er@@ ed a comple@@ te bre@@ ak@@ down , and 30 years later he was living hom@@ eless on the stre@@ ets of Sk@@ id R@@ ow in do@@ wn@@ town L@@ os An@@ gel@@ es .
I en@@ coura@@ ge all of you to read Ste@@ ve &apos;s book or to watch the movie to understand not only the beautiful b@@ ond that formed between these two men , but how music help@@ ed shape that b@@ ond , and ulti@@ mat@@ ely was in@@ strum@@ ent@@ al -- if you &apos;ll par@@ don the p@@ un -- in help@@ ing Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el get off the stre@@ ets .
I met Mr. A@@ y@@ ers in 200@@ 8 , two years ago , at W@@ alt Dis@@ ney Con@@ c@@ ert H@@ all .
He had just heard a per@@ forman@@ ce of Be@@ e@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s First and F@@ our@@ th sym@@ ph@@ on@@ ies , and came back@@ stage and intro@@ duc@@ ed him@@ self .
He was spe@@ a@@ king in a very jo@@ vi@@ al and gre@@ g@@ ari@@ ous way about Y@@ o-@@ Y@@ o M@@ a and H@@ ill@@ ary C@@ lin@@ ton and how the Do@@ d@@ g@@ ers were never going to make the World S@@ eri@@ es , all because of the tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous first vi@@ o@@ lin p@@ as@@ sage work in the last movement of Be@@ e@@ tho@@ ven &apos;s F@@ our@@ th Sy@@ m@@ ph@@ ony .
And we got talking about music , and I got an e@@ ma@@ il from Ste@@ ve a few days later saying that Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el was interested in a vi@@ o@@ lin less@@ on with me .
Now , I should men@@ tion that Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el ref@@ uses treat@@ ment because when he was tre@@ ated it was with sho@@ ck ther@@ ap@@ y and Th@@ or@@ a@@ z@@ ine and hand@@ cu@@ ff@@ s , and that sc@@ ar has sta@@ yed with him for his entire life .
But as a result now , he is pr@@ one to these schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ic ep@@ is@@ o@@ des , the wor@@ st of which can mani@@ fest themselves as him exp@@ lo@@ ding and then dis@@ appe@@ ar@@ ing for days , w@@ ander@@ ing the stre@@ ets of Sk@@ id R@@ ow , ex@@ pos@@ ed to its hor@@ r@@ ors , with the tor@@ ment of his own mind un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed up@@ on him .
And Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el was in such a state of ag@@ it@@ ation when we started our first less@@ on at W@@ alt Dis@@ ney Con@@ c@@ ert H@@ all -- he had a kind of man@@ ic gl@@ int in his eyes , he was lost .
And he was talking about inv@@ isi@@ ble demon@@ s and s@@ mo@@ ke , and how someone was po@@ is@@ on@@ ing him in his sle@@ ep .
And I was a@@ fra@@ id , not for myself , but I was a@@ fra@@ id that I was going to lose him , that he was going to sin@@ k into one of his st@@ ates , and that I would ru@@ in his relationship with the vi@@ o@@ lin if I started talking about sc@@ ales and ar@@ pe@@ g@@ gi@@ os and other exciting forms of di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic vi@@ o@@ lin pe@@ da@@ go@@ g@@ y .
So , I just started playing .
And I play@@ ed the first movement of the Be@@ e@@ tho@@ ven Vi@@ o@@ lin Con@@ cer@@ to .
And as I play@@ ed , I under@@ stood that there was a pro@@ found change oc@@ curr@@ ing in Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el &apos;s eyes .
It was as if he was in the gri@@ p of some inv@@ isi@@ ble ph@@ ar@@ ma@@ c@@ eu@@ tical , a chem@@ ical re@@ action , for which my playing the music was its cat@@ aly@@ st .
And Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el &apos;s man@@ ic ra@@ ge was trans@@ formed into understanding , a qui@@ et cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity and gra@@ ce .
And in a mi@@ ra@@ cle , he li@@ f@@ ted his own vi@@ o@@ lin and he started playing , by e@@ ar , certain s@@ ni@@ pp@@ ets of vi@@ o@@ lin con@@ cer@@ to@@ s which he then asked me to comple@@ te -- Men@@ d@@ el@@ s@@ so@@ h@@ n , T@@ cha@@ i@@ ko@@ v@@ sky , Si@@ be@@ li@@ us .
And we started talking about music , from B@@ ach to Be@@ e@@ tho@@ ven and Bra@@ h@@ ms , Bru@@ ck@@ ner , all the B &apos;s , from Bar@@ t@@ ó@@ k , all the way up to E@@ sa@@ -@@ P@@ ek@@ ka S@@ al@@ onen .
And I under@@ stood that he not only had an en@@ cy@@ clo@@ pedi@@ c knowledge of music , but he rel@@ ated to this music at a personal level .
He spo@@ ke about it with the kind of passi@@ on and understanding that I share with my col@@ le@@ ag@@ ues in the L@@ os An@@ gel@@ es Ph@@ il@@ har@@ mon@@ ic .
And through playing music and talking about music , this man had trans@@ formed from the par@@ an@@ o@@ id , dis@@ tur@@ bed man that had just come from walking the stre@@ ets of do@@ wn@@ town L@@ os An@@ gel@@ es to the char@@ ming , er@@ u@@ di@@ te , bri@@ lli@@ ant , Ju@@ illi@@ ar@@ d-@@ tra@@ ined mus@@ ici@@ an .
Mus@@ ic is medic@@ ine . Mus@@ ic changes us .
And for Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el , music is s@@ an@@ ity .
Because music allo@@ ws him to take his thou@@ ghts and d@@ el@@ usi@@ ons and shape them through his imag@@ in@@ ation and his cre@@ ativity , into reality .
And that is an es@@ cap@@ e from his tor@@ ment@@ ed state .
And I under@@ stood that this was the very ess@@ ence of art .
This was the very reason why we made music , that we take something that ex@@ ists within all of us at our very fundamental cor@@ e , our emo@@ tions , and through our arti@@ sti@@ c l@@ ens , through our cre@@ ativity , we &apos;re able to shape those emo@@ tions into reality .
And the reality of that ex@@ pression re@@ ach@@ es all of us and mo@@ ves us , in@@ spir@@ es and un@@ it@@ es us .
And for Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el , music brought him back into a f@@ old of friends .
The re@@ de@@ mp@@ tive power of music brought him back into a family of mus@@ ici@@ ans that under@@ stood him , that recogni@@ zed his tal@@ ents and res@@ p@@ ected him .
And I will always make music with Na@@ th@@ ani@@ el , whether we &apos;re at W@@ alt Dis@@ ney Con@@ c@@ ert H@@ all or on Sk@@ id R@@ ow , because he re@@ minds me why I became a mus@@ ici@@ an .
Thank you .
Br@@ un@@ o Gi@@ us@@ s@@ an@@ i : Thank you . Th@@ an@@ ks .
Ro@@ bert G@@ up@@ ta .
Ro@@ bert G@@ up@@ ta : I &apos;m going to play something that I sh@@ am@@ el@@ ess@@ ly st@@ ole from c@@ elli@@ sts .
So , please for@@ give me .
I &apos;m J@@ ane Mc@@ G@@ on@@ ig@@ al . I &apos;m a game desig@@ ner .
I &apos;ve been making games online now for 10 years , and my goal for the next dec@@ ade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games .
Now , I have a plan for this , and it ent@@ ail@@ s conv@@ inc@@ ing more people , inclu@@ ding all of you , to spend more time playing bigger and better games .
Right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games .
Some of you might be thinking , &quot; That &apos;s a lot of time to spend playing games .
Maybe too much time , consi@@ der@@ ing how many ur@@ gent problems we have to solve in the real world . &quot;
But actually , ac@@ cor@@ ding to my research at the Institu@@ te for the F@@ ut@@ ure , actually the op@@ posi@@ te is true .
Th@@ ree billion hours a week is not ne@@ arly enough game play to solve the world &apos;s most ur@@ gent problems .
In fact , I believe that if we want to survi@@ ve the next century on this planet , we need to incre@@ ase that total drama@@ tically .
I &apos;ve calcul@@ ated the total we need at 2@@ 1 billion hours of game play every week .
So , that &apos;s probably a bit of a co@@ unter@@ -@@ intu@@ i@@ tive idea , so I &apos;ll say it again , let it sin@@ k in : If we want to solve problems like h@@ unger , poverty , climate change , global conf@@ lic@@ t , o@@ bes@@ ity , I believe that we need to as@@ p@@ ire to play games online for at least 2@@ 1 billion hours a week , by the end of the next dec@@ ade .
No . I &apos;m serious . I am .
Here &apos;s why .
This picture pretty much su@@ ms up why I think games are so ess@@ ential to the future survi@@ v@@ al of the human species . T@@ ru@@ ly .
This is a por@@ tra@@ it by photograp@@ her P@@ hi@@ l T@@ ol@@ e@@ dan@@ o .
He wanted to cap@@ ture the emo@@ tion of g@@ am@@ ing , so he set up a camera in front of g@@ am@@ ers while they were playing .
And this is a cl@@ assi@@ c g@@ am@@ ing emo@@ tion .
Now , if you &apos;re not a g@@ am@@ er , you might mis@@ s some of the nu@@ ance in this ph@@ o@@ to .
You probably see the sense of ur@@ gen@@ cy , a little bit of fe@@ ar , but inten@@ se con@@ cent@@ ration , deep , deep focus on t@@ ac@@ kl@@ ing a really difficult problem .
If you are a g@@ am@@ er , you will notice a few nu@@ an@@ ces here : the cr@@ in@@ k@@ le of the eyes up , and around the m@@ outh is a sig@@ n of op@@ tim@@ ism , and the e@@ ye@@ bro@@ ws up is sur@@ pr@@ ise .
This is a g@@ am@@ er who &apos;s on the ver@@ ge of something called an &quot; epi@@ c win . &quot;
Oh , you &apos;ve heard of that .
OK , good , so we have some g@@ am@@ ers am@@ ong us .
An epi@@ c win is an out@@ come that is so extra@@ ordin@@ arily positive , you had no idea it was even possible until you ach@@ i@@ ev@@ ed it .
It was almost beyond the th@@ res@@ hold of imag@@ in@@ ation , and when you get there , you &apos;re sho@@ cked to disco@@ ver what you &apos;re tru@@ ly cap@@ able of .
That &apos;s an epi@@ c win .
This is a g@@ am@@ er on the ver@@ ge of an epi@@ c win .
And this is the face that we need to see on millions of proble@@ m@@ -@@ sol@@ vers all over the world as we try to t@@ ack@@ le the ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les of the next century -- the face of someone who , against all od@@ ds , is on the ver@@ ge of an epi@@ c win .
Now , un@@ fortun@@ ately this is more of the face that we see in every@@ day life now as we try to t@@ ack@@ le ur@@ gent problems .
This is what I call the &quot; I &apos;m Not Go@@ od At Life &quot; face .
This is actually me making it . Can you see ? Yes . Go@@ od .
This is me making the &quot; I &apos;m Not Go@@ od At Life &quot; face .
This is a piece of gra@@ ff@@ it@@ i in my old neigh@@ bor@@ hood in Ber@@ k@@ el@@ ey , C@@ aliforni@@ a , where I did my Ph@@ D on why we &apos;re better in games than we are in real life .
And this is a problem that a lot of g@@ am@@ ers have .
We feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games .
I don &apos;t mean just good as in success@@ ful , al@@ though that &apos;s part of it .
We do ach@@ ie@@ ve more in game wor@@ l@@ ds .
But I also mean good as in mo@@ tiv@@ ated to do something that mat@@ ters -- inspi@@ red to coll@@ abor@@ ate and to co@@ oper@@ ate .
And when we &apos;re in game wor@@ l@@ ds , I believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves -- the most likely to help at a moment &apos;s notice , the most likely to sti@@ ck with a problem as long at it takes , to get up after fail@@ ure and try again .
And in real life , when we face fail@@ ure , when we con@@ front ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les , we often don &apos;t feel that way .
We feel over@@ come , we feel over@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ed , we feel an@@ xi@@ ous , maybe de@@ pres@@ sed , fru@@ str@@ ated or cy@@ ni@@ cal .
We never have those feel@@ ings when we &apos;re playing games , they just don &apos;t ex@@ ist in games .
So that &apos;s what I wanted to study when I was a gradu@@ ate student .
What about games makes it impossible to feel that we can &apos;t ach@@ ie@@ ve everything ?
How can we take those feel@@ ings from games and app@@ ly them to re@@ al@@ -@@ world work ?
So I looked at games like World of War@@ cra@@ ft , which is really the ide@@ al coll@@ abor@@ ative proble@@ m@@ -@@ sol@@ ving environment .
And I started to notice a few things that make epi@@ c w@@ ins so possible in online wor@@ l@@ ds .
The first thing is wh@@ en@@ ever you show up in one of these online games , especially in World of War@@ cra@@ ft , there are lots and lots of different charac@@ ters who are will@@ ing to tr@@ ust you with a wor@@ l@@ d-@@ sa@@ ving mission , right away .
But not just any mission , it &apos;s a mission that is perf@@ ec@@ tly mat@@ ched with your curr@@ ent level in the game .
Right ? So you can do it .
They never give you a challenge you can &apos;t ach@@ ie@@ ve .
But it is on the ver@@ ge of what you &apos;re cap@@ able of , so you have to try hard .
But there &apos;s no un@@ emp@@ lo@@ y@@ ment in World of War@@ cra@@ ft ; no sitting around , wr@@ ing@@ ing your hands -- there &apos;s always something speci@@ fic and important to be done .
There are also t@@ ons of coll@@ abor@@ ators .
Every@@ where you go , hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to ach@@ ie@@ ve your epi@@ c mission .
That &apos;s not something we have in real life that eas@@ ily , this sense that at our f@@ ing@@ er@@ ti@@ ps are t@@ ons of coll@@ abor@@ ators .
And there &apos;s this epi@@ c story , this in@@ spir@@ ing story of why we &apos;re there , and what we &apos;re doing , and we get all this positive fe@@ ed@@ back .
You guys have heard of le@@ vel@@ ing up , + 1 str@@ eng@@ th , + 1 intelligen@@ ce .
We don &apos;t get that kind of con@@ st@@ ant fe@@ ed@@ back in real life .
When I get off this stage , I &apos;m not going to have + 1 spe@@ a@@ king , and + 1 cra@@ zy idea , + 20 cra@@ zy idea .
I don &apos;t get that fe@@ ed@@ back in real life .
Now , the problem with coll@@ abor@@ ative online environ@@ ments like World of War@@ cra@@ ft is that it &apos;s so sa@@ tis@@ f@@ ying to be on the ver@@ ge of an epi@@ c win all the time , we deci@@ de to spend all our time in these game wor@@ l@@ ds .
It &apos;s just better than reality .
So , so far , collec@@ tively all the World of War@@ cra@@ ft g@@ am@@ ers have spent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years sol@@ ving the vir@@ tual problems of A@@ zer@@ ot@@ h .
Now , that &apos;s not necess@@ arily a bad thing .
It might sound like it &apos;s a bad thing .
But to put that in context : 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years ago was when our ear@@ li@@ est pri@@ mate human an@@ c@@ est@@ ors stood up .
That was the first up@@ right pri@@ mate .
So when we talk about how much time we &apos;re curr@@ ently inves@@ ting in playing games , the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the mag@@ nit@@ ude of human evolution , which is an extraordinary thing .
But it &apos;s also ap@@ t , because it turns out that by sp@@ ending all this time playing games , we &apos;re actually changing what we are cap@@ able of as human beings .
We &apos;re evol@@ ving to be a more coll@@ abor@@ ative and hear@@ ty species .
This is true . I believe this .
So , consi@@ der this really interesting statisti@@ c ; it was recently publi@@ shed by a resear@@ cher at Car@@ neg@@ ie M@@ ell@@ on University : The average young person today in a country with a strong g@@ am@@ er culture will have spent 10@@ ,000 hours playing online games by the age of 2@@ 1 .
Now 10@@ ,000 hours is a really interesting number for two reasons .
First of all , for children in the United States , 10@@ ,@@ 0@@ 80 hours is the ex@@ act amount of time you will spend in school , from fi@@ f@@ th gra@@ de to high school gradu@@ ation , if you have perfect atten@@ dan@@ ce .
So , we have an entire par@@ alle@@ l tra@@ ck of education going on , where young people are learning as much about what it takes to be a good g@@ am@@ er as they &apos;re learning about everything else in school .
Some of you have probably read Mal@@ col@@ m Gl@@ ad@@ well &apos;s new book &quot; O@@ ut@@ li@@ ers , &quot; so you would have heard of his theory of success , the &quot; 10@@ ,000 hours &quot; theory of success .
It &apos;s based on this great c@@ ogni@@ tiv@@ e-@@ science research that says if we can ma@@ ster 10@@ ,000 hours of eff@@ or@@ t@@ ful study at anything by the age of 2@@ 1 , we will be vir@@ tu@@ os@@ os at it .
We will be as good at whatever we do as the great@@ est people in the world .
And so , now what we &apos;re looking at is an entire generation of young people who are vir@@ tu@@ os@@ o g@@ am@@ ers .
So , the big question is , &quot; What exactly are g@@ am@@ ers getting so good at ? &quot;
Because if we could figure that out , we would have a vir@@ tually un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented human res@@ ource on our hands .
This is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games .
These are our vir@@ tu@@ os@@ o g@@ am@@ ers , 500 million people who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily good at something .
And in the next dec@@ ade , we &apos;re going to have another billion g@@ am@@ ers who are extra@@ ordin@@ arily good at whatever that is .
If you don &apos;t know it already , this is coming .
The game industry is developing con@@ sol@@ es that are low@@ -@@ energy and that work with the wir@@ eless phone net@@ works instead of bro@@ ad@@ band Internet , so that g@@ am@@ ers all over the world , particularly in India , China , Bra@@ zi@@ l , can get online .
They expect one billion more g@@ am@@ ers in the next dec@@ ade .
It will bring us up to 1@@ .@@ 5 billion g@@ am@@ ers .
So I &apos;ve started to think about what these games are making us vir@@ tu@@ os@@ os at .
Here are the four things I came up with . The first is ur@@ gent op@@ tim@@ ism .
OK , think of this as extre@@ me self-@@ mo@@ tiv@@ ation .
Ur@@ gent op@@ tim@@ ism is the des@@ ire to act immedi@@ ately to t@@ ack@@ le an ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le , com@@ bin@@ ed with the belie@@ f that we have a reas@@ on@@ able hope of success .
G@@ am@@ ers always believe that an epi@@ c win is possible , and that it &apos;s always worth trying , and trying now .
G@@ am@@ ers don &apos;t sit around .
G@@ am@@ ers are vir@@ tu@@ os@@ os at we@@ a@@ ving a ti@@ ght social f@@ ab@@ ric .
There &apos;s a lot of interesting research that shows we like people better after we play a game with them , even if they &apos;ve be@@ aten us b@@ ad@@ ly .
And the reason is , it takes a lot of tr@@ ust to play a game with someone .
We tr@@ ust that they will spend their time with us , that they will play by the same rules , value the same goal , stay with the game until it &apos;s over .
And so , playing a game together actually buil@@ ds up b@@ on@@ ds and tr@@ ust and co@@ oper@@ ation .
And we actually build stron@@ ger social relation@@ ships as a result .
Bli@@ s@@ s@@ ful produc@@ tivity . I love it .
You know , there &apos;s a reason why the average World of War@@ cra@@ ft g@@ am@@ er pla@@ ys for 2@@ 2 hours a week -- kind of a hal@@ f-@@ time job .
It &apos;s because we know , when we &apos;re playing a game , that we &apos;re actually happ@@ ier working hard than we are rel@@ a@@ x@@ ing , or han@@ ging out .
We know that we are op@@ ti@@ mi@@ zed as human beings , to do hard and mean@@ ing@@ ful work .
And g@@ am@@ ers are will@@ ing to work hard all the time , if they &apos;re given the right work .
Fin@@ ally : epi@@ c meaning .
G@@ am@@ ers love to be at@@ ta@@ ched to a@@ we@@ -@@ in@@ spir@@ ing mis@@ sions to human plan@@ et@@ ar@@ y-@@ scale stories .
So , just one bit of tri@@ vi@@ a that hel@@ ps put that into perspec@@ tive : So , you all know Wikipedia , biggest wi@@ k@@ i in the world .
Second biggest wi@@ k@@ i in the world , with ne@@ arly 8@@ 0,000 artic@@ les , is the World of War@@ cra@@ ft wi@@ k@@ i .
Fi@@ ve million people use it every month .
They have comp@@ il@@ ed more information about World of War@@ cra@@ ft on the Internet than any other top@@ ic co@@ vered on any other wi@@ k@@ i in the world .
They are building an epi@@ c story .
They are building an epi@@ c knowledge res@@ ource about the World of War@@ cra@@ ft .
Okay , so these are four super@@ power@@ s that add up to one thing : G@@ am@@ ers are super@@ -@@ em@@ power@@ ed hop@@ eful individu@@ als .
These are people who believe that they are individu@@ ally cap@@ able of changing the world .
And the only problem is , they believe that they are cap@@ able of changing vir@@ tual wor@@ l@@ ds and not the real world .
That &apos;s the problem that I &apos;m trying to solve .
There &apos;s an econom@@ ist named E@@ d@@ ward C@@ a@@ stron@@ o@@ v@@ a .
H@@ is work is bri@@ lli@@ ant .
He looks at why people are inves@@ ting so much time and energy and money in online wor@@ l@@ ds .
And he says , &quot; We &apos;re wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ing what amoun@@ ts to no less than a mass ex@@ od@@ us to vir@@ tual wor@@ l@@ ds and online game environ@@ ments . &quot;
And he &apos;s an econom@@ ist , so he &apos;s ra@@ tional .
And he says -- Not like me , I &apos;m a game desig@@ ner ; I &apos;m ex@@ u@@ ber@@ ant .
But he says that this makes perfect sense , because g@@ am@@ ers can ach@@ ie@@ ve more in online wor@@ l@@ ds than they can in real life .
They can have stron@@ ger social relation@@ ships in games than they can have in real life ; they get better fe@@ ed@@ back and feel more re@@ war@@ ded in games than they do in real life .
So he says , for now it makes perfect sense for g@@ am@@ ers to spend more time in vir@@ tual wor@@ l@@ ds than the real world .
Now , I also ag@@ ree that that is ra@@ tional , for now .
But it is not , by any means , an op@@ ti@@ mal situation .
We have to start making the real world work more like a game .
I take my inspi@@ ration from something that happened 2@@ ,@@ 500 years ago .
These are an@@ ci@@ ent di@@ ce , made out of sh@@ e@@ ep &apos;s k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les .
Be@@ fore we had a@@ wes@@ ome game contro@@ ll@@ ers , we had sh@@ e@@ ep &apos;s k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les .
And these repres@@ ent the first game equi@@ p@@ ment designed by human beings , and if you &apos;re famili@@ ar with the work of the an@@ ci@@ ent Gre@@ ek hist@@ ori@@ an Her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , you might know this history , which is the history of who inv@@ ented games and why .
Her@@ od@@ ot@@ us says that games , particularly di@@ ce games , were inv@@ ented in the k@@ ing@@ dom of L@@ y@@ di@@ a , during a time of fam@@ ine .
A@@ p@@ par@@ ently , there was such a sever@@ e fam@@ ine that the king of L@@ y@@ di@@ a decided they had to do something cra@@ zy .
People were suff@@ ering . People were fi@@ gh@@ ting .
It was an extre@@ me situation , they needed an extre@@ me solution .
So , ac@@ cor@@ ding to Her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , they inv@@ ented di@@ ce games , and they set up a k@@ ing@@ dom@@ -@@ wi@@ de polic@@ y : On one day , everybody would eat , and on the next day , everybody would play games .
And they would be so im@@ mer@@ sed in playing the di@@ ce games , because games are so eng@@ aging , and im@@ mer@@ se us in such sa@@ tis@@ f@@ ying , bli@@ s@@ s@@ ful produc@@ tivity , they would ignor@@ e the fact that they had no food to eat .
And then on the next day , they would play games ; and on the next day , they would eat .
And ac@@ cor@@ ding to Her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , they pass@@ ed 18 years this way , survi@@ ving through a fam@@ ine , by e@@ ating on one day , and playing games on the next .
Now , this is exactly , I think , how we &apos;re using games today .
We &apos;re using games to es@@ cap@@ e re@@ al@@ -@@ world suff@@ ering -- we &apos;re using games to get away from everything that &apos;s bro@@ ken in the real environment , everything that &apos;s not sa@@ tis@@ f@@ ying about real life , and we &apos;re getting what we need from games .
But it doesn &apos;t have to end there .
This is really exciting .
Ac@@ cor@@ ding to Her@@ od@@ ot@@ us , after 18 years the fam@@ ine wasn &apos;t getting better , so the king decided they would play one fin@@ al di@@ ce game .
They di@@ vi@@ ded the entire k@@ ing@@ dom in half .
They play@@ ed one di@@ ce game , and the w@@ inn@@ ers of that game got to go on an epi@@ c ad@@ vent@@ ure .
They would leave L@@ y@@ di@@ a , and they would go out in sear@@ ch of a new place to live , lea@@ ving behind just enough people to survi@@ ve on the resources that were available , and hop@@ efully to take their ci@@ vili@@ zation somewhere else where they could th@@ ri@@ ve .
Now , this so@@ unds cra@@ zy , right ?
But recently , DNA evidence has sho@@ wn that the E@@ tr@@ us@@ c@@ ans , who then led to the R@@ om@@ an E@@ mp@@ ire , actually share the same DNA as the an@@ ci@@ ent L@@ y@@ di@@ ans .
And so , recently , scientists have sug@@ ges@@ ted that Her@@ od@@ ot@@ us &apos; cra@@ zy story is actually true .
And ge@@ olog@@ ists have found evidence of a global co@@ ol@@ ing that la@@ st@@ ed for ne@@ arly 20 years , that could have expla@@ ined the fam@@ ine .
So this cra@@ zy story might be true .
They might have actually sa@@ ved their culture by playing games , es@@ cap@@ ing to games for 18 years , and then been so inspi@@ red , and knew so much about how to come together with games , that they actually sa@@ ved the entire ci@@ vili@@ zation that way .
Okay , we can do that .
We &apos;ve been playing War@@ cra@@ ft since 199@@ 4 .
That was the first re@@ al@@ -@@ time strat@@ eg@@ y game from the World of War@@ cra@@ ft series .
That was 16 years ago .
They play@@ ed di@@ ce games for 18 years , we &apos;ve been playing War@@ cra@@ ft for 16 years .
I say we are ready for our own epi@@ c game .
Now , they had half the ci@@ vili@@ zation go off in sear@@ ch of a new world , so that &apos;s where I get my 2@@ 1 billion hours a week of g@@ am@@ e-@@ play from .
Let &apos;s get half of us to ag@@ ree to spend an hour a day playing games , until we solve re@@ al@@ -@@ world problems .
Now , I know you &apos;re asking , &quot; How are we going to solve re@@ al@@ -@@ world problems in games ? &quot;
Well , that &apos;s what I &apos;ve de@@ v@@ ot@@ ed my work to over the past few years , at the Institu@@ te for the F@@ ut@@ ure .
We have this ban@@ ner in our off@@ ices in Pal@@ o Al@@ to , and it ex@@ pres@@ ses our view of how we should try to rel@@ ate to the future .
We do not want to try to predic@@ t the future .
What we want to do is make the future .
We want to imagine the best@@ -@@ case sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o out@@ come , and then we want to em@@ power people to make that out@@ come a reality .
We want to imagine epi@@ c w@@ ins , and then give people the means to ach@@ ie@@ ve the epi@@ c win .
I &apos;m just going to very b@@ rie@@ fly show you three games that I &apos;ve made that are an att@@ em@@ pt to give people the means to create epi@@ c w@@ ins in their own fut@@ ures .
This is World Wi@@ th@@ out O@@ il .
We made this game in 200@@ 7 .
This is an online game in which you try to survi@@ ve an oil sh@@ or@@ ta@@ ge .
The oil sh@@ or@@ ta@@ ge is fic@@ tional , but we put enough online cont@@ ent out there for you to believe that it &apos;s real , and to live your real life as if we &apos;ve run out of oil . So when you come to the game , you sig@@ n up , tell us where you live , and then we give you re@@ al@@ -@@ time news vide@@ os , data fe@@ e@@ ds that show you exactly how much oil cos@@ ts , what &apos;s not available , how food supp@@ ly is being aff@@ ected ,
how transp@@ or@@ tation is being aff@@ ected , if schools are clos@@ ed , if there &apos;s ri@@ ot@@ ing , and you have to figure out how you would live your real life as if this were true . And then we ask you to blo@@ g about it , to p@@ ost vide@@ os , to p@@ ost phot@@ os .
We p@@ il@@ ot@@ ed this game with 1,@@ 7@@ 00 play@@ ers in 200@@ 7 , and we &apos;ve tra@@ cked them for the three years since .
And I can tell you that this is a trans@@ forma@@ tive experience .
No@@ body wants to change how they live , just because it &apos;s good for the world , or because we &apos;re supposed to .
But if you im@@ mer@@ se them in an epi@@ c ad@@ vent@@ ure and tell them , &quot; We &apos;ve run out of oil .
This is an amazing story and ad@@ vent@@ ure for you to go on .
Ch@@ allen@@ ge yourself to see how you would survi@@ ve , &quot; most of our play@@ ers have ke@@ pt up the hab@@ its that they learned in this game .
So for the next wor@@ l@@ d-@@ sa@@ ving game , we decided to a@@ im higher -- bigger problem than just pe@@ ak oil .
We did a game called Super@@ struc@@ t at the Institu@@ te for the F@@ ut@@ ure .
And the pre@@ mis@@ e was , a super@@ computer has calcul@@ ated that humans have only 2@@ 3 years left on the planet .
This super@@ computer was called the Glob@@ al Ex@@ tin@@ ction A@@ war@@ en@@ ess System , of course .
We asked people to come online -- almost like a J@@ er@@ ry Bru@@ ck@@ hei@@ mer movie .
You know J@@ er@@ ry Bru@@ ck@@ hei@@ mer mo@@ vi@@ es , you form a dre@@ am team -- you &apos;ve got the a@@ stron@@ aut , the scienti@@ st , the ex@@ -@@ con@@ vi@@ ct , and they all have something to do to save the world .
But in our game , instead of just having five people on the dre@@ am team , we said , &quot; Every@@ body &apos;s on the dre@@ am team , and it &apos;s your job to inv@@ ent the future of energy , the future of food , the future of health , the future of sec@@ urity and the future of the social sa@@ f@@ ety net . &quot;
We had 8@@ ,000 people play that game for eight weeks .
They came up with 500 ins@@ an@@ ely creative sol@@ utions that you can go online , Google &quot; Super@@ struc@@ t , &quot; and see .
So , finally , the last game , we &apos;re la@@ un@@ ching it Mar@@ ch 3@@ r@@ d . This is a game done with the World B@@ ank Institu@@ te .
If you comple@@ te the game , you will be cer@@ ti@@ fied by the World B@@ ank Institu@@ te as a So@@ cial Innov@@ ator , class of 20@@ 10 .
Wor@@ king with uni@@ versi@@ ties all over sub@@ -S@@ ah@@ ar@@ an Africa , and we are inv@@ iting them to learn social innovation sk@@ ills .
We &apos;ve got a grap@@ hic nov@@ el , we &apos;ve got le@@ vel@@ ing up in sk@@ ills like local in@@ si@@ ght , knowledge net@@ working , sustain@@ ability , vision and res@@ our@@ ce@@ f@@ ul@@ ness .
I would like to in@@ vi@@ te all of you to please share this game with young people , any@@ where in the world , particularly in developing areas , who might benef@@ it from coming together to try to start to imagine their own social enter@@ pris@@ es to save the world .
So , I &apos;m going to w@@ ra@@ p up now .
I want to ask a question .
What do you think happens next ?
We &apos;ve got all these amazing g@@ am@@ ers , we &apos;ve got these games that are kind of p@@ il@@ ots of what we might do , but n@@ one of them have sa@@ ved the real world yet .
Well I hope you will ag@@ ree with me that g@@ am@@ ers are a human res@@ ource that we can use to do re@@ al@@ -@@ world work , that games are a powerful plat@@ form for change .
We have all these amazing super@@ power@@ s : bli@@ s@@ s@@ ful produc@@ tivity , the ability to we@@ a@@ ve a ti@@ ght social f@@ ab@@ ric , this feeling of ur@@ gent op@@ tim@@ ism and the des@@ ire for epi@@ c meaning .
I really hope that we can come together to play games that matter , to survi@@ ve on this planet for another century .
That &apos;s my hope , that you will jo@@ in me in making and playing games like this .
When I look forward to the next dec@@ ade , I know two things for sure : that we can make any future we can imagine , and we can play any games we want , so I say : Let the wor@@ l@@ d-@@ changing games begin .
Thank you .
For some time I have been interested in the plac@@ e@@ b@@ o effect , which might seem like an od@@ d thing for a ma@@ gi@@ ci@@ an to be interested in , un@@ less you think of it in the terms that I do , which is , &quot; Some@@ thing fa@@ ke is be@@ liev@@ ed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real . &quot;
In other words , su@@ gar p@@ ills have a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in certain kinds of stu@@ dies , the plac@@ e@@ b@@ o effect , just because the person thin@@ ks that what &apos;s happening to them is a ph@@ ar@@ ma@@ c@@ eu@@ tical or some sort of a -- for pa@@ in man@@ a@@ gement , for example , if they believe it enough there is a meas@@ ur@@ able effect in the body called the plac@@ e@@ b@@ o effect .
Some@@ thing fa@@ ke becomes something real because of someone &apos;s perc@@ ep@@ tion of it .
In order for us to understand each other , I want to start by showing you a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary , very simple ma@@ gic tri@@ ck .
And I &apos;m going to show you how it works . This is a tri@@ ck that &apos;s been in every children &apos;s ma@@ gic book since at least the 19@@ 5@@ 0s .
I learned it myself from C@@ u@@ b S@@ c@@ out Ma@@ gic in the 197@@ 0s .
I &apos;ll do it for you , and then I &apos;ll explain it .
And then I &apos;ll explain why I expla@@ ined it .
So , here &apos;s what happens .
The k@@ ni@@ fe , which you can exam@@ ine ; my hand , which you could exam@@ ine .
I &apos;m just going to hold the k@@ ni@@ fe in my f@@ ist like this .
I &apos;ll get my sle@@ e@@ ve back .
And to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle@@ e@@ ve I &apos;m just going to squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze my wr@@ ist right here .
That way you can see that at no time can anything tra@@ vel , as long as I &apos;m squ@@ e@@ e@@ zing there nothing can go up or down my sle@@ e@@ ve .
And the object of this is quite simple .
I &apos;m going to open my hand , and hop@@ efully , if all is well , my p@@ ure animal magne@@ tis@@ m will hold the k@@ ni@@ fe .
In fact it &apos;s hel@@ d so ti@@ gh@@ tly in place that I can sha@@ ke it , and the k@@ ni@@ fe does not come off .
No@@ thing goes up or down my sle@@ e@@ ve , no tri@@ ck@@ er@@ y . And you can exam@@ ine everything .
Ta@@ -@@ da !
So , this is a tri@@ ck that I often teach to young children that are interested in ma@@ gic , because you can learn a great deal about dec@@ ep@@ tion by stu@@ dying this very -- even though it &apos;s a very simple tri@@ ck me@@ tho@@ d@@ ologi@@ cally .
Pro@@ bab@@ ly many of you in the room know this tri@@ ck .
What happens is this .
I hold the k@@ ni@@ fe in my hand .
I say I &apos;m going to gra@@ b hold of my wr@@ ist to make sure nothing goes up or down my sle@@ e@@ ve , that is a l@@ ie .
The reason I &apos;m hol@@ ding onto my wr@@ ist is because that &apos;s actually the sec@@ re@@ t of the ill@@ usion .
In a moment when my hand mo@@ ves from fac@@ ing you to being away from you , this f@@ inger right here , my in@@ de@@ x f@@ inger is just going to shi@@ ft from where it is , to a position poin@@ ting out like this .
Ni@@ ce one .
Some@@ one who didn &apos;t have a chil@@ d@@ hood is out there .
So , it goes like this , from here , right .
And as I move around my f@@ inger shi@@ f@@ ts .
And we could talk about why this is dec@@ ep@@ tive , why you don &apos;t notice there are only three f@@ ing@@ ers down here , because the mind , and the way it process@@ es information , it doesn &apos;t coun@@ t , one , two , three . It groups them .
But that &apos;s not really what this is about . Right ? And then I open my hand up .
Ob@@ vi@@ ously it &apos;s cl@@ ing@@ ing there , not by animal magne@@ tis@@ m , but by ch@@ ic@@ an@@ er@@ y , my in@@ de@@ x f@@ inger being there .
And then when I close my f@@ inger , same thing , as I move back , this mo@@ tion kind of co@@ vers the moving back of my f@@ inger .
I take this hand away . You give the k@@ ni@@ fe out .
There is a tri@@ ck you can do for your friends and neigh@@ b@@ ors . Th@@ an@@ ks .
Now , what does that have to do with the plac@@ e@@ b@@ o effect ?
I read a study a year or so ago that really ble@@ w my mind wi@@ de open .
I &apos;m not a doc@@ tor or a resear@@ cher , so this , to me , was an ast@@ on@@ ishing thing .
It turns out that if you ad@@ minis@@ ter a plac@@ e@@ b@@ o in the form of a white p@@ ill , that &apos;s like as@@ p@@ ir@@ in shap@@ ed -- it &apos;s just a ro@@ und white p@@ ill -- it has some certain meas@@ ur@@ able effect .
But if you change the form that you give the plac@@ e@@ b@@ o in , like you make a sm@@ aller p@@ ill , and color it blue , and stam@@ p a let@@ ter into it , it is actually meas@@ ur@@ ably more effec@@ tive .
Even though nei@@ ther one of these things has any ph@@ ar@@ ma@@ c@@ eu@@ tical -- they &apos;re su@@ gar p@@ ills .
But a white p@@ ill is not as good as a blue p@@ ill .
What ? That really fli@@ pped me out .
Tur@@ ns out though , that that &apos;s not even where it st@@ op@@ s .
If you have cap@@ s@@ ules , they &apos;re more effec@@ tive than t@@ ab@@ le@@ ts in any form .
A col@@ or@@ ed cap@@ su@@ le , that &apos;s y@@ el@@ low on one end and red on the other is better than a white cap@@ su@@ le .
D@@ os@@ age has something to do with this .
One p@@ ill t@@ wi@@ ce a day is not as good at three p@@ ills -- I don &apos;t remember the statisti@@ c now . Sor@@ ry .
But the point is ...
... these d@@ os@@ ages have something to do with it .
And the form has something to do with it .
And if you want the ulti@@ mate in plac@@ e@@ b@@ o , you &apos;ve go to the nee@@ d@@ le .
Right ? A sy@@ r@@ in@@ ge with some in@@ ert -- a couple C@@ C@@ s of some in@@ ert something , and you in@@ ject this into a patient ...
Well this is such a powerful image in their mind , it &apos;s so much stron@@ ger than the white p@@ ill .
It &apos;s a really , this grap@@ h , well I &apos;ll show it to you some other time when we have sli@@ des .
The point is the white p@@ ill is not as good as the blue p@@ ill is not as good as the cap@@ su@@ le is not as good as the nee@@ d@@ le .
And n@@ one of it has any real ph@@ ar@@ ma@@ c@@ eu@@ tical quality , it &apos;s only your belie@@ f that makes it real in your body and makes a stron@@ ger effect .
I wanted to see if I could take that idea and app@@ ly it to a ma@@ gic tri@@ ck .
And take something that is obviously a fa@@ ke tri@@ ck and make it seem real .
And we know from that study that when you want reality , you go to the nee@@ d@@ le .
This is a se@@ ven@@ -@@ in@@ ch hat@@ p@@ in . It &apos;s very , very shar@@ p , and I &apos;m going to just st@@ eri@@ li@@ ze it a tiny bit .
This is really my fl@@ es@@ h . This is not Dam@@ ian &apos;s speci@@ al@@ -@@ gro@@ wn fl@@ es@@ h .
That &apos;s my skin right there . This is not a H@@ olly@@ wood special effect .
I &apos;m going to pi@@ er@@ ce my skin and run this nee@@ d@@ le through to the other side .
If you &apos;re qu@@ easy -- if you fa@@ int eas@@ ily -- I was doing this for some friends in the h@@ ot@@ el room last night , and some people that I didn &apos;t know , and one woman almost pass@@ ed out .
So , I sug@@ gest if you get qu@@ easy easy that you look away for about the next 30 -- in fact , you know what , I &apos;ll do the first bad part behind it .
You &apos;ll get to see , you can look away too if you &apos;d like to .
So , here is what happens , right here , the beginning of my fl@@ es@@ h at the lower part of my arm I just make a little pi@@ er@@ ce .
I &apos;m sor@@ ry , man . Am I fre@@ a@@ king you out ?
OK , and then just through my skin a tiny bit , and then out the other side like this .
Now , essentially we &apos;re in the same position we were in with the k@@ ni@@ fe tri@@ ck .
S@@ ort of .
But you can &apos;t coun@@ t my f@@ ing@@ ers right now can you ?
So , let me show them to you . That &apos;s one , two three , four , five .
Yes , well ...
I know what people think when they see this .
They go , &quot; Well , he &apos;s certainly not d@@ um@@ b enough to sta@@ b him@@ self through the skin to enter@@ tain us for a few minutes .
So , let me give you a little pe@@ ek .
How &apos;s that look out there ? P@@ re@@ tty good .
Yeah , I know . And the people in the back go , &quot; OK , I didn &apos;t really see that . &quot;
People in the sat@@ elli@@ te room are starting to move in now .
Let me give you good close look at this .
That really is my skin . That is not a H@@ olly@@ wood special effect .
That &apos;s my fl@@ es@@ h , and I can t@@ w@@ ist that around .
I &apos;m sor@@ ry . If you &apos;re getting qu@@ easy , look away , don &apos;t look at the thing .
People in the back or people on video years from now wat@@ ching this will go , &quot; Well yeah , that looks kind of ne@@ at in some sort of effect there , but if it were real he would be -- see there &apos;s a h@@ ole there and a h@@ ole there , if it were real he would be ble@@ e@@ ding .
Well let me work up some blood for you .
Yes , there it is .
Nor@@ m@@ ally now , I would take the nee@@ d@@ le out .
I would cle@@ an off my arm , and I would show you that there are no wo@@ unds .
But I think in this context and with the idea of taking something fa@@ ke and making it into something real , I &apos;m just going to leave it there , and walk off the stage .
I will be seeing you several times over the next few days .
I hope you &apos;re looking forward to that . Thank you very much .
So , I &apos;ve known a lot of fish in my life .
I &apos;ve lo@@ ved only two .
That first one , it was more like a passi@@ on@@ ate aff@@ air .
It was a beautiful fish : f@@ la@@ vor@@ ful , tex@@ tu@@ red , me@@ at@@ y , a bes@@ ts@@ eller on the men@@ u .
What a fish .
Even better , it was far@@ m@@ -@@ ra@@ is@@ ed to the supposed high@@ est stand@@ ards of sustain@@ ability .
So you could feel good about s@@ ell@@ ing it .
I was in a relationship with this beau@@ ty for several months .
One day , the head of the company called and asked if I &apos;d speak at an ev@@ ent about the far@@ m &apos;s sustain@@ ability .
&quot; Ab@@ sol@@ utely , &quot; I said .
Here was a company trying to solve what &apos;s become this uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able problem for us ch@@ ef@@ s : How do we keep fish on our men@@ us ?
For the past 50 years , we &apos;ve been f@@ ishing the se@@ as like we clear@@ -@@ cut for@@ ests .
It &apos;s hard to o@@ verst@@ ate the des@@ tru@@ ction .
N@@ in@@ ety percent of large fish , the ones we love -- the t@@ un@@ as , the hal@@ i@@ bu@@ ts , the sal@@ mon@@ s , s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish -- they &apos;ve coll@@ ap@@ sed .
There &apos;s almost nothing left .
So , for better or for wor@@ se , a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture , fish far@@ ming , is going to be a part of our future .
A lot of arg@@ um@@ ents against it : F@@ ish far@@ ms poll@@ ute -- most of them do any@@ way -- and they &apos;re in@@ effici@@ ent . Ta@@ ke t@@ un@@ a , a major dra@@ w@@ back .
It &apos;s got a fe@@ ed conver@@ sion ra@@ ti@@ o of 15 to one .
That means it takes fi@@ f@@ te@@ en po@@ unds of wi@@ ld fish to get you one po@@ und of far@@ m t@@ un@@ a .
Not very sustain@@ able .
It doesn &apos;t ta@@ ste very good either .
So here , finally , was a company trying to do it right .
I wanted to support them .
The day before the ev@@ ent , I called the head of P@@ .@@ R@@ . for the company .
Let &apos;s call him Don .
&quot; Don , &quot; I said , &quot; just to get the fac@@ ts stra@@ ight , you guys are famous for far@@ ming so far out to sea , you don &apos;t poll@@ ute . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s right , &quot; he said . &quot; We &apos;re so far out , the wa@@ ste from our fish gets dis@@ tri@@ but@@ ed , not con@@ cent@@ r@@ ated . &quot;
And then he ad@@ ded , &quot; We &apos;re basically a world un@@ to ourselves .
That fe@@ ed conver@@ sion ra@@ ti@@ o ? 2@@ .@@ 5 to one , &quot; he said .
&quot; B@@ est in the business . &quot;
2@@ .@@ 5 to one , great .
&quot; 2@@ .@@ 5 what ? What are you fe@@ e@@ ding ? &quot;
&quot; Su@@ sta@@ in@@ able prot@@ eins , &quot; he said .
&quot; Gre@@ at , &quot; I said . G@@ ot off the phone .
And that night , I was l@@ ying in bed , and I thought : What the h@@ ell is a sustain@@ able prot@@ ein ?
So the next day , just before the ev@@ ent , I called Don .
I said , &quot; Don , what are some examples of sustain@@ able prot@@ eins ? &quot;
He said he didn &apos;t know . He would ask around .
Well , I got on the phone with a few people in the company ; no one could give me a stra@@ ight answer until finally , I got on the phone with the head biolog@@ ist .
Let &apos;s call him Don too .
&quot; Don , &quot; I said , &quot; what are some examples of sustain@@ able prot@@ eins ? &quot;
Well , he men@@ tion@@ ed some al@@ ga@@ es and some fish me@@ als , and then he said chi@@ cken p@@ el@@ le@@ ts .
I said , &quot; Chi@@ cken p@@ el@@ le@@ ts ? &quot;
He said , &quot; Yeah , fe@@ a@@ thers , skin , b@@ one me@@ al , sc@@ rap@@ s , dri@@ ed and process@@ ed into fe@@ ed . &quot;
I said , &quot; What perc@@ ent@@ age of your fe@@ ed is chi@@ cken ? &quot;
Th@@ in@@ king , you know , two percent .
&quot; Well , it &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
I said , &quot; Don , what &apos;s sustain@@ able about fe@@ e@@ ding chi@@ cken to fish ? &quot;
There was a long p@@ ause on the line , and he said , &quot; There &apos;s just too much chi@@ cken in the world . &quot;
I f@@ ell out of love with this fish .
No , not because I &apos;m some self-@@ ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous , go@@ od@@ y-@@ two sho@@ es fo@@ o@@ die .
I actually am .
No , I actually f@@ ell out of love with this fish because , I swe@@ ar to God , after that conver@@ sation , the fish ta@@ st@@ ed like chi@@ cken .
This second fish , it &apos;s a different kind of love story .
It &apos;s the roman@@ tic kind , the kind where the more you get to know your fish , you love the fish .
I first ate it at a res@@ tau@@ r@@ ant in sou@@ th@@ ern Spa@@ in .
A jour@@ n@@ alist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time .
She kind of set us up .
It came to the table a b@@ right , almost shi@@ mm@@ ering , white color .
The che@@ f had over@@ co@@ o@@ ked it .
Like t@@ wi@@ ce over .
A@@ ma@@ z@@ ingly , it was still deli@@ ci@@ ous .
Who can make a fish ta@@ ste good after it &apos;s been over@@ co@@ o@@ ked ?
I can &apos;t , but this guy can .
Let &apos;s call him M@@ ig@@ u@@ el -- actually his name is M@@ ig@@ u@@ el .
And no , he didn &apos;t co@@ ok the fish , and he &apos;s not a che@@ f , at least in the way that you and I understand it .
He &apos;s a biolog@@ ist at V@@ et@@ a L@@ a Pal@@ ma .
It &apos;s a fish far@@ m in the sou@@ th@@ wes@@ tern cor@@ ner of Spa@@ in .
It &apos;s at the ti@@ p of the Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r ri@@ ver .
Un@@ til the 198@@ 0s , the far@@ m was in the hands of the Ar@@ gent@@ ini@@ ans .
They ra@@ is@@ ed be@@ e@@ f c@@ att@@ le on what was essentially w@@ et@@ l@@ ands .
They did it by dra@@ ining the land .
They built this in@@ tri@@ c@@ ate series of can@@ als , and they p@@ ush@@ ed water off the land and out into the ri@@ ver .
Well , they couldn &apos;t make it work , not econom@@ ically .
And ec@@ ologi@@ cally , it was a dis@@ a@@ ster .
It kill@@ ed like 90 percent of the bir@@ ds , which , for this place , is a lot of bir@@ ds .
And so in 198@@ 2 , a Sp@@ an@@ ish company with an environ@@ mental con@@ science pur@@ ch@@ as@@ ed the land .
What did they do ?
They re@@ vers@@ ed the f@@ low of water .
They literally fli@@ pped the s@@ wit@@ ch .
In@@ stead of p@@ ush@@ ing water out , they used the chan@@ n@@ els to p@@ ull water back in .
They f@@ loo@@ ded the can@@ als .
They created a 2@@ 7@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ ac@@ re fish far@@ m -- b@@ ass , m@@ ul@@ let , sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p , e@@ el -- and in the process , M@@ ig@@ u@@ el and this company completely re@@ vers@@ ed the ec@@ ological des@@ tru@@ ction .
The far@@ m &apos;s incredible .
I mean , you &apos;ve never seen anything like this .
You st@@ are out at a h@@ ori@@ z@@ on that is a million miles away , and all you see are f@@ loo@@ ded can@@ als and this th@@ ick , rich mar@@ sh@@ land .
I was there not long ago with M@@ ig@@ u@@ el .
He &apos;s an amazing guy , like three parts Charles Dar@@ win and one part C@@ ro@@ co@@ di@@ le D@@ un@@ de@@ e .
Okay ? There we are s@@ log@@ ging through the w@@ et@@ l@@ ands , and I &apos;m pan@@ ting and swe@@ ating , got mu@@ d up to my k@@ ne@@ es , and M@@ ig@@ u@@ el &apos;s cal@@ m@@ ly con@@ duc@@ ting a biology lec@@ ture .
Here , he &apos;s poin@@ ting out a r@@ are Bl@@ ack@@ -@@ sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der@@ ed K@@ ite .
Now , he &apos;s men@@ tion@@ ing the min@@ er@@ al needs of ph@@ y@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton .
And here , here he se@@ es a grou@@ p@@ ing pattern that re@@ minds him of the T@@ anz@@ ani@@ an Gi@@ ra@@ ffe .
It turns out , M@@ ig@@ u@@ el spent the better part of his car@@ e@@ er in the Mik@@ um@@ i National Par@@ k in Africa .
I asked him how he became such an exper@@ t on fish .
He said , &quot; F@@ ish ? I didn &apos;t know anything about fish .
I &apos;m an exper@@ t in relation@@ ships . &quot;
And then he &apos;s off , la@@ un@@ ching into more talk about r@@ are bir@@ ds and al@@ ga@@ es and st@@ range a@@ qu@@ ati@@ c plants .
And don &apos;t get me wrong , that was really fas@@ cin@@ ating , you know , the bio@@ tic community un@@ pl@@ u@@ g@@ ged , kind of thing .
It &apos;s great , but I was in love .
And my head was s@@ wo@@ on@@ ing over that over@@ co@@ o@@ ked piece of deli@@ ci@@ ous fish I had the night before .
So I inter@@ ru@@ p@@ ted him . I said , &quot; M@@ ig@@ u@@ el , what makes your fish ta@@ ste so good ? &quot;
He poin@@ ted at the al@@ ga@@ e .
&quot; I know , du@@ de , the al@@ ga@@ e , the ph@@ y@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the relation@@ ships : It &apos;s amazing .
But what are your fish e@@ ating ?
What &apos;s the fe@@ ed conver@@ sion ra@@ ti@@ o ? &quot;
Well , he goes on to tell me it &apos;s such a rich system that the fish are e@@ ating what they &apos;d be e@@ ating in the wi@@ ld .
The plant bi@@ om@@ ass , the ph@@ y@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the zo@@ op@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , it &apos;s what fe@@ e@@ ds the fish .
The system is so heal@@ thy , it &apos;s totally self-@@ ren@@ e@@ wing .
There is no fe@@ ed .
E@@ ver heard of a far@@ m that doesn &apos;t fe@@ ed its animals ?
L@@ ater that day , I was dri@@ ving around this proper@@ ty with M@@ ig@@ u@@ el , and I asked him , I said , &quot; For a place that seems so natural , un@@ like like any far@@ m I &apos;d ever been at , how do you measure success ? &quot;
At that moment , it was as if a film direc@@ tor called for a set change .
And we ro@@ und@@ ed the cor@@ ner and saw the most amazing si@@ ght : thousands and thousands of p@@ ink fl@@ am@@ in@@ go@@ s , a liter@@ al p@@ ink car@@ pe@@ t for as far as you could see .
&quot; That &apos;s success , &quot; he said .
&quot; Look at their bel@@ lies , p@@ ink .
They &apos;re fe@@ ast@@ ing . &quot;
Fe@@ ast@@ ing ? I was totally conf@@ used .
I said , &quot; M@@ ig@@ u@@ el , aren &apos;t they fe@@ ast@@ ing on your fish ? &quot;
&quot; Yes , &quot; he said .
&quot; We lose 20 percent of our fish and fish eg@@ gs to bir@@ ds .
Well , last year , this proper@@ ty had 6@@ 00@@ ,000 bir@@ ds on it , more than 2@@ 50 different species .
It &apos;s become , today , the largest and one of the most important private b@@ ird s@@ an@@ c@@ tu@@ ar@@ ies in all of Europe . &quot;
I said , &quot; M@@ ig@@ u@@ el , isn &apos;t a th@@ ri@@ ving b@@ ird population like the last thing you want on a fish far@@ m ? &quot;
He sh@@ ook his head , no .
He said , &quot; We far@@ m ex@@ ten@@ si@@ v@@ ely , not inten@@ si@@ v@@ ely .
This is an ec@@ ological network .
The fl@@ am@@ in@@ go@@ s eat the sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p .
The sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p eat the ph@@ y@@ top@@ lan@@ k@@ ton .
So the p@@ in@@ ker the bel@@ ly , the better the system . &quot;
Okay , so let &apos;s re@@ view : a far@@ m that doesn &apos;t fe@@ ed its animals , and a far@@ m that meas@@ ures its success on the health of its pre@@ dat@@ ors .
A fish far@@ m , but also a b@@ ird s@@ an@@ c@@ tu@@ ary .
Oh , and by the way , those fl@@ am@@ in@@ go@@ s , they sh@@ ouldn &apos;t even be there in the first place .
They bro@@ od in a town 150 miles away , where the so@@ il condi@@ tions are better for building n@@ ests .
Every morning , they fly 150 miles into the far@@ m .
And every ev@@ ening , they fly 150 miles back .
They do that because they &apos;re able to follow the bro@@ ken white line of high@@ way A@@ 9@@ 2 .
No ki@@ d@@ ding .
I was imag@@ ining a &quot; Mar@@ ch of the P@@ en@@ gu@@ ins &quot; thing , so I looked at M@@ ig@@ u@@ el .
I said , &quot; M@@ ig@@ u@@ el , do they fly 150 miles to the far@@ m , and then do they fly 150 miles back at night ?
Do they do that for the children ? &quot;
He looked at me like I had just quot@@ ed a Wh@@ it@@ ney H@@ ou@@ st@@ on song .
He said , &quot; No ; they do it because the food &apos;s better . &quot;
I didn &apos;t men@@ tion the skin of my bel@@ o@@ ved fish , which was deli@@ ci@@ ous -- and I don &apos;t like fish skin ; I don &apos;t like it se@@ ared , I don &apos;t like it cris@@ p@@ y .
It &apos;s that ac@@ ri@@ d , t@@ ar@@ -@@ like f@@ la@@ vor .
I almost never co@@ ok with it .
Y@@ et , when I ta@@ st@@ ed it at that res@@ tau@@ r@@ ant in sou@@ th@@ ern Spa@@ in , it ta@@ st@@ ed not at all like fish skin .
It ta@@ st@@ ed swe@@ et and cle@@ an , like you were taking a bi@@ te of the ocean .
I men@@ tion@@ ed that to M@@ ig@@ u@@ el , and he no@@ d@@ ded .
He said , &quot; The skin ac@@ ts like a sp@@ on@@ ge .
It &apos;s the last def@@ en@@ se before anything en@@ ters the body .
It evol@@ ved to so@@ ak up im@@ pu@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
And then he ad@@ ded , &quot; But our water has no im@@ pu@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
OK . A far@@ m that doesn &apos;t fe@@ ed its fish , a far@@ m that meas@@ ures its success by the success of its pre@@ dat@@ ors .
And then I realized when he says , &quot; A far@@ m that has no im@@ pu@@ ri@@ ties , &quot; he made a big under@@ stat@@ ement , because the water that flo@@ ws through that far@@ m comes in from the Gu@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r Ri@@ ver .
It &apos;s a ri@@ ver that car@@ ries with it all the things that ri@@ vers tend to car@@ ry these days : chem@@ ical cont@@ am@@ in@@ ants , p@@ esti@@ ci@@ de run@@ off .
And when it works its way through the system and lea@@ ves , the water is cle@@ an@@ er than when it enter@@ ed .
The system is so heal@@ thy , it pu@@ ri@@ fi@@ es the water .
So , not just a far@@ m that doesn &apos;t fe@@ ed its animals , not just a far@@ m that meas@@ ures its success by the health of its pre@@ dat@@ ors , but a far@@ m that &apos;s literally a water pu@@ ri@@ fic@@ ation plant -- and not just for those fish , but for you and me as well .
Because when that water lea@@ ves , it d@@ um@@ ps out into the At@@ lan@@ tic .
A dro@@ p in the ocean , I know , but I &apos;ll take it , and so should you , because this love story , ho@@ we@@ ver roman@@ tic , is also in@@ struc@@ tive .
You might say it &apos;s a reci@@ p@@ e for the future of good food , whether we &apos;re talking about b@@ ass or be@@ e@@ f c@@ att@@ le .
What we need now is a ra@@ dic@@ ally new conc@@ ep@@ tion of ag@@ ri@@ culture , one in which the food actually ta@@ stes good .
But for a lot people , that &apos;s a bit too radi@@ cal .
We &apos;re not re@@ alis@@ ts , us fo@@ o@@ dies ; we &apos;re lo@@ vers .
We love far@@ mers &apos; mark@@ ets , we love small family far@@ ms , we talk about local food , we eat organ@@ ic .
And when you sug@@ gest these are the things that will en@@ sure the future of good food , someone , somewhere stand@@ s up and says , &quot; Hey guy , I love p@@ ink fl@@ am@@ in@@ go@@ s , but how are you going to fe@@ ed the world ? &quot;
How are you going to fe@@ ed the world ?
Can I be hon@@ est ?
I don &apos;t love that question .
No , not because we already produce enough cal@@ ories to more than fe@@ ed the world .
One billion people will go h@@ un@@ gr@@ y today .
One billion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of gros@@ s ine@@ qu@@ ali@@ ties in dis@@ tribu@@ tion , not ton@@ n@@ age .
Now , I don &apos;t love this question because it &apos;s de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed the lo@@ gic of our food system for the last 50 years .
Fe@@ ed gra@@ in to her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , p@@ esti@@ ci@@ des to mon@@ o@@ cul@@ tures , chem@@ ic@@ als to so@@ il , chi@@ cken to fish , and all along ag@@ ri@@ business has simply asked , &quot; If we &apos;re fe@@ e@@ ding more people more che@@ ap@@ ly , how terri@@ ble could that be ? &quot;
That &apos;s been the mo@@ tiv@@ ation , it &apos;s been the j@@ us@@ ti@@ fic@@ ation : it &apos;s been the business plan of American ag@@ ri@@ culture .
We should call it what it is : a business in li@@ qui@@ dation , a business that &apos;s quickly er@@ o@@ ding ec@@ ological cap@@ ital that makes that very produc@@ tion possible .
That &apos;s not a business , and it isn &apos;t ag@@ ri@@ culture .
Our bre@@ ad@@ bas@@ k@@ et is thre@@ aten@@ ed today , not because of di@@ min@@ ishing supp@@ ly , but because of di@@ min@@ ishing resources .
Not by the l@@ at@@ est com@@ b@@ ine and tra@@ c@@ tor inv@@ en@@ tion , but by fer@@ ti@@ le land ; not by p@@ um@@ ps , but by fres@@ h water ; not by cha@@ in@@ sa@@ ws , but by for@@ ests ; and not by f@@ ishing bo@@ ats and n@@ ets , but by fish in the sea .
W@@ ant to fe@@ ed the world ?
Let &apos;s start by asking : How are we going to fe@@ ed ourselves ?
Or better : How can we create condi@@ tions that en@@ able every community to fe@@ ed itself ?
To do that , don &apos;t look at the ag@@ ri@@ business model for the future .
It &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s ti@@ red .
It &apos;s high on cap@@ ital , chem@@ is@@ try and mach@@ ines , and it &apos;s never produc@@ ed anything really good to eat .
In@@ stead , let &apos;s look to the ec@@ ological model .
That &apos;s the one that re@@ lies on two billion years of on-@@ the@@ -@@ job experience .
Look to M@@ ig@@ u@@ el , far@@ mers like M@@ ig@@ u@@ el .
Far@@ ms that aren &apos;t wor@@ l@@ ds un@@ to themselves ; far@@ ms that res@@ t@@ ore instead of de@@ ple@@ te ; far@@ ms that far@@ m ex@@ ten@@ si@@ v@@ ely instead of just inten@@ si@@ v@@ ely ; far@@ mers that are not just produc@@ ers , but exper@@ ts in relation@@ ships .
Because they &apos;re the ones that are exper@@ ts in f@@ la@@ vor , too .
And if I &apos;m going to be really hon@@ est , they &apos;re a better che@@ f than I &apos;ll ever be .
You know , I &apos;m okay with that , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it &apos;s going to be deli@@ ci@@ ous .
Thank you .
I gre@@ w up on a ste@@ ad@@ y di@@ et of science fic@@ tion .
In high school , I took a b@@ us to school an hour each way every day .
And I was always ab@@ sor@@ bed in a book , science fic@@ tion book , which took my mind to other wor@@ l@@ ds , and sa@@ tis@@ fied , in a nar@@ ra@@ tive form , this in@@ sa@@ ti@@ able sense of cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity that I had .
And you know , that cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity also mani@@ fes@@ ted itself in the fact that wh@@ en@@ ever I wasn &apos;t in school I was out in the w@@ oo@@ ds , hi@@ king and taking &quot; sam@@ ples &quot; -- fro@@ gs and s@@ n@@ ak@@ es and bu@@ gs and pon@@ d water -- and br@@ ing@@ ing it back , looking at it under the mic@@ ros@@ cope .
You know , I was a real science ge@@ ek .
But it was all about trying to understand the world , understand the limit@@ s of possi@@ bility .
And my love of science fic@@ tion actually seem@@ ed m@@ ir@@ r@@ or@@ ed in the world around me , because what was happening , this was in the late &apos; 6@@ 0s , we were going to the mo@@ on , we were explor@@ ing the deep oce@@ ans .
J@@ ac@@ qu@@ es C@@ ou@@ ste@@ au was coming into our living ro@@ oms with his amazing speci@@ als that showed us animals and places and a w@@ on@@ dr@@ ous world that we could never really have pre@@ vi@@ ously imag@@ ined .
So , that seem@@ ed to res@@ on@@ ate with the whole science fic@@ tion part of it .
And I was an arti@@ st .
I could dra@@ w . I could pa@@ int .
And I found that because there weren &apos;t video games and this s@@ atur@@ ation of C@@ G mo@@ vi@@ es and all of this ima@@ ger@@ y in the media land@@ sc@@ ape , I had to create these images in my head .
You know , we all did , as kids having to read a book , and through the auth@@ or &apos;s descri@@ ption , put something on the movie screen in our he@@ ads .
And so , my response to this was to pa@@ int , to dra@@ w alien cre@@ atures , alien wor@@ l@@ ds , ro@@ bot@@ s , spac@@ es@@ hi@@ ps , all that stuff .
I was end@@ less@@ ly getting bu@@ st@@ ed in mat@@ h class do@@ od@@ ling behind the tex@@ t@@ book .
That was -- the cre@@ ativity had to find its out@@ let somehow .
And an interesting thing happened : The J@@ ac@@ qu@@ es C@@ ou@@ ste@@ au shows actually got me very exc@@ ited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on Earth .
I might not really go to an alien world on a spac@@ es@@ hi@@ p some@@ day -- that seem@@ ed pretty dar@@ n un@@ likely .
But that was a world I could really go to , right here on Earth , that was as rich and ex@@ o@@ tic as anything that I had imag@@ ined from read@@ ing these books .
So , I decided I was going to become a sc@@ ub@@ a di@@ ver at the age of 15 .
And the only problem with that was that I lived in a little village in Can@@ ad@@ a , 600 miles from the ne@@ ar@@ est ocean .
But I didn &apos;t let that da@@ unt me .
I p@@ es@@ ter@@ ed my father until he finally found a sc@@ ub@@ a class in Bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , New York , right across the bor@@ der from where we live .
And I actually got cer@@ ti@@ fied in a po@@ ol at a Y@@ M@@ CA in the dead of win@@ ter in Bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , New York .
And I didn &apos;t see the ocean , a real ocean , for another two years , until we moved to C@@ aliforni@@ a .
Sin@@ ce then , in the inter@@ ven@@ ing 40 years , I &apos;ve spent about 3@@ ,000 hours under@@ water , and 500 hours of that was in sub@@ mer@@ si@@ b@@ les .
And I &apos;ve learned that that deep@@ -@@ ocean environment , and even the sh@@ allow oce@@ ans , are so rich with amazing life that really is beyond our imag@@ in@@ ation .
Nat@@ ure &apos;s imag@@ in@@ ation is so bo@@ und@@ less compar@@ ed to our own me@@ ager human imag@@ in@@ ation .
I still , to this day , stand in absol@@ ute a@@ we of what I see when I make these di@@ ves .
And my love aff@@ air with the ocean is on@@ going , and just as strong as it ever was .
But when I ch@@ ose a car@@ e@@ er as an ad@@ ult , it was fil@@ m@@ making .
And that seem@@ ed to be the best way to re@@ con@@ ci@@ le this ur@@ ge I had to tell stories with my ur@@ ges to create images .
And I was , as a kid , con@@ st@@ antly dra@@ wing com@@ ic books , and so on .
So , fil@@ m@@ making was the way to put pictures and stories together , and that made sense .
And of course the stories that I ch@@ ose to tell were science fic@@ tion stories : &quot; Ter@@ min@@ ator , &quot; &quot; A@@ li@@ ens &quot; and &quot; The Ab@@ ys@@ s . &quot;
And with &quot; The Ab@@ ys@@ s , &quot; I was putting together my love of under@@ water and di@@ ving with fil@@ m@@ making .
So , you know , mer@@ ging the two passi@@ ons .
Some@@ thing interesting came out of &quot; The Ab@@ ys@@ s , &quot; which was that to solve a speci@@ fic nar@@ ra@@ tive problem on that film , which was to create this kind of li@@ qu@@ id water cre@@ ature , we actually em@@ bra@@ ced computer gener@@ ated an@@ ima@@ tion , C@@ G .
And this res@@ ul@@ ted in the first so@@ ft@@ -@@ surface charac@@ ter , C@@ G an@@ ima@@ tion that was ever in a movie .
And even though the film didn &apos;t make any money -- bar@@ ely bro@@ ke even , I should say -- I wit@@ n@@ ess@@ ed something amazing , which is that the audience , the global audience , was mes@@ m@@ eri@@ zed by this ap@@ par@@ ent ma@@ gic .
You know , it &apos;s Ar@@ th@@ ur C@@ lar@@ ke &apos;s law that any suff@@ ici@@ ently advan@@ ced technology is in@@ dist@@ ing@@ u@@ is@@ hab@@ le from ma@@ gic .
They were seeing something ma@@ gi@@ cal .
And so that got me very exc@@ ited .
And I thought , &quot; W@@ ow , this is something that needs to be em@@ bra@@ ced into the c@@ ine@@ ma@@ tic art . &quot;
So , with &quot; Ter@@ min@@ ator 2 , &quot; which was my next film , we took that much far@@ ther .
Wor@@ king with I@@ L@@ M , we created the li@@ qu@@ id met@@ al du@@ de in that film . The success h@@ ung in the bal@@ ance on whether that effect would work .
And it did , and we created ma@@ gic again , and we had the same result with an audience -- al@@ though we did make a little more money on that one .
So , dra@@ wing a line through those two d@@ ots of experience came to , &quot; This is going to be a whole new world , &quot; this was a whole new world of cre@@ ativity for film arti@@ sts .
So , I started a company with St@@ an W@@ inst@@ on , my good friend St@@ an W@@ inst@@ on , who is the pre@@ mi@@ er ma@@ k@@ e-@@ up and cre@@ ature desig@@ ner at that time , and it was called D@@ ig@@ ital D@@ om@@ ain .
And the con@@ cept of the company was that we would le@@ ap@@ fro@@ g past the an@@ al@@ o@@ g process@@ es of op@@ tical pr@@ inter@@ s and so on , and we would go right to digital produc@@ tion .
And we actually did that and it gave us a compe@@ ti@@ tive advan@@ ta@@ ge for a while .
But we found ourselves l@@ ag@@ ging in the m@@ id &apos; 9@@ 0s in the cre@@ ature and charac@@ ter design stuff that we had actually fo@@ und@@ ed the company to do .
So , I wrote this piece called &quot; A@@ v@@ at@@ ar , &quot; which was me@@ ant to absolutely p@@ ush the en@@ vel@@ op@@ e of visual eff@@ ects , of C@@ G eff@@ ects , beyond , with re@@ alis@@ tic human emo@@ tive charac@@ ters gener@@ ated in C@@ G , and the main charac@@ ters would all be in C@@ G , and the world would be in C@@ G .
And the en@@ vel@@ op@@ e p@@ ush@@ ed back , and I was told by the fol@@ ks at my company that we weren &apos;t going to be able to do this for a while .
So , I sh@@ el@@ ved it , and I made this other movie about a big ship that sin@@ ks .
You know , I went and p@@ it@@ ched it to the studi@@ o as &quot; &apos; R@@ ome@@ o and Ju@@ lie@@ t &apos; on a ship : &quot; It &apos;s going to be this epi@@ c roman@@ ce , passi@@ on@@ ate film . &quot;
S@@ ec@@ re@@ tly , what I wanted to do was I wanted to di@@ ve to the real w@@ re@@ ck of &quot; Tit@@ an@@ ic . &quot;
And that &apos;s why I made the movie .
And that &apos;s the truth . Now , the studi@@ o didn &apos;t know that .
But I conv@@ inc@@ ed them . I said , &quot; We &apos;re going to di@@ ve to the w@@ re@@ ck . We &apos;re going to film it for real .
We &apos;ll be using it in the op@@ ening of the film .
It will be really important . It will be a great mark@@ eting h@@ ook . &quot;
And I talked them into fund@@ ing an ex@@ pedi@@ tion .
So@@ unds cra@@ zy . But this goes back to that the@@ me about your imag@@ in@@ ation creating a reality .
Because we actually created a reality where six months later , I find myself in a Rus@@ si@@ an sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble two and a half miles down in the nor@@ th At@@ lan@@ tic , looking at the real Tit@@ an@@ ic through a view p@@ ort .
Not a movie , not H@@ D -- for real .
Now , that ble@@ w my mind .
And it took a lot of pre@@ par@@ ation , we had to build c@@ ameras and li@@ ghts and all kinds of things .
But , it stru@@ ck me how much this di@@ ve , these deep di@@ ves , was like a space mission .
You know , where it was high@@ ly techni@@ cal , and it re@@ qui@@ red enorm@@ ous plan@@ ning .
You get in this cap@@ su@@ le , you go down to this dark h@@ os@@ ti@@ le environment where there is no hope of res@@ c@@ ue if you can &apos;t get back by yourself .
And I thought like , &quot; W@@ ow . I &apos;m like , living in a science fic@@ tion movie .
This is really cool . &quot;
And so , I really got bit@@ ten by the bu@@ g of deep@@ -@@ ocean explor@@ ation .
Of course , the cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity , the science comp@@ on@@ ent of it -- it was everything . It was ad@@ vent@@ ure , it was cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity , it was imag@@ in@@ ation .
And it was an experience that H@@ olly@@ wood couldn &apos;t give me .
Because , you know , I could imagine a cre@@ ature and we could create a visual effect for it . But I couldn &apos;t imagine what I was seeing out that win@@ d@@ ow .
As we did some of our sub@@ sequ@@ ent ex@@ pedi@@ tions , I was seeing cre@@ atures at hydro@@ ther@@ mal v@@ ents and sometimes things that I had never seen before , sometimes things that no one had seen before , that actually were not descri@@ bed by science at the time that we saw them and imag@@ ed them .
So , I was completely s@@ mit@@ ten by this , and had to do more .
And so , I actually made a kind of cu@@ ri@@ ous dec@@ ision .
After the success of &quot; Tit@@ an@@ ic , &quot; I said , &quot; OK , I &apos;m going to par@@ k my day job as a H@@ olly@@ wood movie ma@@ ker , and I &apos;m going to go be a f@@ ull@@ -@@ time explor@@ er for a while . &quot;
And so , we started plan@@ ning these ex@@ pedi@@ tions .
And we wo@@ und up going to the B@@ is@@ mar@@ k , and explor@@ ing it with ro@@ bo@@ tic v@@ eh@@ ic@@ les .
We went back to the Tit@@ an@@ ic w@@ re@@ ck .
We took little bot@@ s that we had created that spo@@ ol@@ ed a fi@@ ber op@@ tic .
And the idea was to go in and do an inter@@ i@@ or sur@@ v@@ ey of that ship , which had never been done .
No@@ body had ever looked inside the w@@ re@@ ck . They didn &apos;t have the means to do it , so we created technology to do it .
So , you know , here I am now , on the de@@ ck of Tit@@ an@@ ic , sitting in a sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble , and looking out at plan@@ ks that look much like this , where I knew that the band had play@@ ed .
And I &apos;m fl@@ ying a little ro@@ bo@@ tic v@@ eh@@ ic@@ le through the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or of the ship .
When I say , &quot; I &apos;m oper@@ ating it , &quot; but my mind is in the v@@ eh@@ ic@@ le .
I felt like I was physi@@ cally present inside the shi@@ p@@ w@@ re@@ ck of Tit@@ an@@ ic .
And it was the most sur@@ real kind of de@@ ja v@@ u experience I &apos;ve ever had , because I would know before I turned a cor@@ ner what was going to be there before the li@@ ghts of the v@@ eh@@ ic@@ le actually re@@ ve@@ al@@ ed it , because I had wal@@ ked the set for months when we were making the movie .
And the set was based as an ex@@ act rep@@ lic@@ a on the b@@ lu@@ e@@ prin@@ ts of the ship .
So , it was this absolutely remark@@ able experience .
And it really made me realize that the tel@@ e@@ pres@@ ence experience -- that you actually can have these ro@@ bo@@ tic av@@ at@@ ars , then your consci@@ ous@@ ness is in@@ j@@ ected into the v@@ eh@@ ic@@ le , into this other form of ex@@ ist@@ ence .
It was really , really quite pro@@ found .
And it may be a little bit of a gli@@ mp@@ se as to what might be happening some dec@@ a@@ des out as we start to have cy@@ bor@@ g bo@@ dies for explor@@ ation or for other means in many sort of pos@@ t-@@ human fut@@ ures that I can imagine , as a science fic@@ tion f@@ an .
So , having done these ex@@ pedi@@ tions , and really beginning to app@@ reci@@ ate what was down there , such as at the deep ocean v@@ ents where we had these amazing , amazing animals -- they &apos;re basically ali@@ ens right here on Earth .
They live in an environment of chem@@ os@@ yn@@ thes@@ is .
They don &apos;t survi@@ ve on sun@@ ligh@@ t-@@ based system the way we do .
And so , you &apos;re seeing animals that are living next to water pl@@ um@@ es .
You think they can &apos;t possi@@ bly ex@@ ist .
At the same time I was getting very interested in space science as well -- again , it &apos;s the science fic@@ tion influ@@ ence , as a kid .
And I wo@@ und up getting involved with the space community , really involved with NASA , sitting on the NASA ad@@ vis@@ ory board , plan@@ ning ac@@ tual space mis@@ sions , going to Rus@@ si@@ a , going through the pre@@ -@@ cos@@ mon@@ aut bi@@ ome@@ di@@ cal prot@@ o@@ col@@ s , and all these sorts of things , to actually go and fly to the inter@@ national space st@@ ation with our 3@@ D camera systems .
And this was fas@@ cin@@ ating .
But what I wo@@ und up doing was br@@ ing@@ ing space scientists with us into the deep .
And taking them down so that they had access -- ast@@ ro@@ biolog@@ ists , plan@@ et@@ ary scientists , people who were interested in these extre@@ me environ@@ ments -- taking them down to the v@@ ents , and le@@ tting them see , and take sam@@ ples and test in@@ strum@@ ents , and so on .
So , here we were making doc@@ um@@ ent@@ ary fil@@ ms , but actually doing science , and actually doing space science .
I &apos;d completely clos@@ ed the loo@@ p between being the science fic@@ tion f@@ an , you know , as a kid , and doing this stuff for real .
And you know , along the way in this journey of disco@@ very , I learned a lot .
I learned a lot about science . But I also learned a lot about lea@@ der@@ ship .
Now you think direc@@ tor has got to be a lea@@ der , lea@@ der of , cap@@ tain of the ship , and all that sort of thing .
I didn &apos;t really learn about lea@@ der@@ ship until I did these ex@@ pedi@@ tions .
Because I had to , at a certain point , say , &quot; What am I doing out here ?
Why am I doing this ? What do I get out of it ? &quot;
We don &apos;t make money at these dam@@ n shows .
We bar@@ ely break even . There is no f@@ ame in it .
People sort of think I went away between &quot; Tit@@ an@@ ic &quot; and &quot; A@@ v@@ at@@ ar &quot; and was bu@@ ff@@ ing my n@@ ail@@ s some@@ place , sitting at the be@@ ach .
Ma@@ de all these fil@@ ms , made all these doc@@ um@@ ent@@ ary fil@@ ms for a very limit@@ ed audience .
No f@@ ame , no gl@@ ory , no money . What are you doing ?
You &apos;re doing it for the t@@ ask itself , for the challenge -- and the ocean is the most challen@@ ging environment there is -- for the th@@ ri@@ ll of disco@@ very , and for that st@@ range b@@ ond that happens when a small group of people form a ti@@ gh@@ tly kn@@ it team .
Because we would do these things with 10 , 12 people , working for years at a time , sometimes at sea for two , three months at a time .
And in that b@@ ond , you realize that the most important thing is the res@@ pect that you have for them and that they have for you , that you &apos;ve done a t@@ ask that you can &apos;t explain to someone else .
When you come back to the sh@@ ore and you say , &quot; We had to do this , and the fi@@ ber op@@ tic , and the att@@ ent@@ uation , and the this and the that , all the technology of it , and the diffic@@ ul@@ ty , the human@@ -@@ per@@ forman@@ ce as@@ p@@ ects of working at sea , &quot; you can &apos;t explain it to people . It &apos;s that thing that maybe cop@@ s have , or people in com@@ b@@ at that have gone through something together and they know they can never explain it .
C@@ re@@ ates a b@@ ond , cre@@ ates a b@@ ond of res@@ pect .
So , when I came back to make my next movie , which was &quot; A@@ v@@ at@@ ar , &quot; I tried to app@@ ly that same princi@@ ple of lea@@ der@@ ship , which is that you res@@ pect your team , and you ear@@ n their res@@ pect in re@@ turn .
And it really changed the dynam@@ ic .
So , here I was again with a small team , in un@@ char@@ ted ter@@ rit@@ ory , doing &quot; A@@ v@@ at@@ ar , &quot; coming up with new technology that didn &apos;t ex@@ ist before .
Tre@@ men@@ d@@ ously exciting .
Tre@@ men@@ d@@ ously challen@@ ging .
And we became a family , over a f@@ our@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ half year period .
And it completely changed how I do mo@@ vi@@ es .
So , people have comm@@ ented on how , &quot; Well , you know , you brought back the ocean organis@@ ms and put them on the planet of P@@ and@@ or@@ a . &quot;
To me , it was more of a fundamental way of doing business , the process itself , that changed as a result of that .
So , what can we syn@@ thes@@ i@@ ze out of all this ?
You know , what are the less@@ ons learned ?
Well , I think number one is cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity .
It &apos;s the most powerful thing you own .
I@@ mag@@ in@@ ation is a force that can actually mani@@ fest a reality .
And the res@@ pect of your team is more important than all the lau@@ rel@@ s in the world .
I have young fil@@ m@@ ma@@ kers come up to me and say , &quot; Gi@@ ve me some ad@@ vice for doing this . &quot;
And I say , &quot; Don &apos;t put limit@@ ations on yourself .
O@@ ther people will do that for you -- don &apos;t do it to yourself , don &apos;t be@@ t against yourself , and take ris@@ ks . &quot;
NASA has this p@@ hr@@ ase that they like : &quot; F@@ ail@@ ure is not an op@@ tion . &quot;
But fail@@ ure has to be an op@@ tion in art and in explor@@ ation , because it &apos;s a lea@@ p of fa@@ it@@ h .
And no important en@@ de@@ a@@ vor that re@@ qui@@ red innovation was done without risk .
You have to be will@@ ing to take those ris@@ ks .
So , that &apos;s the thought I would leave you with , is that in whatever you &apos;re doing , fail@@ ure is an op@@ tion , but fe@@ ar is not . Thank you .
If I can leave you with one big idea today , it &apos;s that the whole of the data in which we consu@@ me is gre@@ ater that the s@@ um of the parts , and instead of thinking about information over@@ lo@@ ad , what I &apos;d like you to think about is how we can use information so that patterns po@@ p and we can see tr@@ ends that would o@@ ther@@ wise be inv@@ isi@@ ble .
So what we &apos;re looking at right here is a ty@@ pic@@ al mor@@ tal@@ ity ch@@ art organi@@ zed by age .
This to@@ ol that I &apos;m using here is a little experiment .
It &apos;s called Pi@@ v@@ ot , and with Pi@@ v@@ ot what I can do is I can cho@@ ose to fil@@ ter in one particular cause of de@@ a@@ ths -- say , ac@@ ci@@ dents .
And , right away , I see there &apos;s a different pattern that em@@ erg@@ es .
This is because , in the mi@@ d-@@ area here , people are at their most active , and over here they &apos;re at their most fra@@ il .
We can step back out again and then re@@ organi@@ ze the data by cause of death , seeing that cir@@ cul@@ at@@ ory dis@@ eas@@ es and cancer are the us@@ ual sus@@ p@@ ects , but not for everyone .
If we go ah@@ ead and we fil@@ ter by age -- say 40 years or less -- we see that ac@@ ci@@ dents are actually the great@@ est cause that people have to be wor@@ ried about .
And if you dri@@ ll into that , it &apos;s especially the case for men .
So you get the idea that vie@@ wing information , vie@@ wing data in this way , is a lot like swi@@ mm@@ ing in a living information in@@ fo@@ -@@ grap@@ hic .
And if we can do this for ra@@ w data , why not do it for cont@@ ent as well ?
So what we have right here is the co@@ ver of every single S@@ por@@ ts I@@ l@@ lu@@ str@@ ated ever produc@@ ed .
It &apos;s all here ; it &apos;s all on the we@@ b .
You can go back to your ro@@ oms and try this after my talk .
With Pi@@ v@@ ot , you can dri@@ ll into a dec@@ ade .
You can dri@@ ll into a particular year .
You can j@@ ump right into a speci@@ fic issue .
So I &apos;m looking at this ; I see the a@@ th@@ let@@ es that have appe@@ ared in this issue , the sp@@ or@@ ts .
I &apos;m a L@@ ance Arm@@ strong f@@ an , so I &apos;ll go ah@@ ead and I &apos;ll cli@@ ck on that , which re@@ ve@@ als , for me , all the issues in which L@@ ance Arm@@ strong &apos;s been a part of .
Now , if I want to just kind of take a pe@@ ek at these , I might think , &quot; Well , what about taking a look at all of cy@@ cl@@ ing ? &quot;
So I can step back , and exp@@ and on that .
And I see Gre@@ g Le@@ Mon@@ d now .
And so you get the idea that when you n@@ avi@@ g@@ ate over information this way -- going nar@@ ro@@ wer , bro@@ a@@ der , bac@@ king in , bac@@ king out -- you &apos;re not sear@@ ching , you &apos;re not bro@@ w@@ sing .
You &apos;re doing something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
It &apos;s in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
So I want to ex@@ tr@@ ap@@ ol@@ ate on this idea a bit with something that &apos;s a little bit cra@@ zy .
What we &apos;re done here is we &apos;ve taken every single Wikipedia page and we re@@ duc@@ ed it down to a little su@@ mm@@ ary .
So the su@@ mm@@ ary con@@ s@@ ists of just a little sy@@ no@@ p@@ s@@ is and an ic@@ on to in@@ dic@@ ate the top@@ ical area that it comes from .
I &apos;m only showing the top 500 most pop@@ ular Wikipedia p@@ ages right here .
But even in this limit@@ ed view , we can do a lot of things .
Right away , we get a sense of what are the top@@ ical dom@@ a@@ ins that are most pop@@ ular on Wikipedia .
I &apos;m going to go ah@@ ead and sel@@ ect government .
Now , having sel@@ ected government , I can now see that the Wikipedia cat@@ eg@@ ories that most fre@@ qu@@ ently cor@@ respon@@ d to that are Ti@@ me ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine People of the Ye@@ ar .
So this is really important because this is an in@@ si@@ ght that was not con@@ tain@@ ed within any one Wikipedia page .
It &apos;s only possible to see that in@@ si@@ ght when you step back and look at all of them .
L@@ oo@@ king at one of these particular su@@ mm@@ ar@@ ies , I can then dri@@ ll into the con@@ cept of Ti@@ me ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine Person of the Ye@@ ar , br@@ ing@@ ing up all of them .
So looking at these people , I can see that the maj@@ ority come from government ; some have come from natural sci@@ ences ; some , fe@@ wer still , have come from business -- there &apos;s my b@@ os@@ s -- and one has come from music .
And inter@@ est@@ ingly enough , Bon@@ o is also a TED Pri@@ ze w@@ inner .
So we can go , j@@ ump , and take a look at all the TED Pri@@ ze w@@ inn@@ ers .
So you see , we &apos;re n@@ avi@@ g@@ ating the we@@ b for the first time as if it &apos;s actually a we@@ b , not from pa@@ ge@@ -@@ to-@@ page , but at a higher level of ab@@ stra@@ ction .
And so I want to show you one other thing that may cat@@ ch you a little bit by sur@@ pr@@ ise .
I &apos;m just showing the New York Times we@@ bsite here .
So Pi@@ v@@ ot , this app@@ lic@@ ation -- I don &apos;t want to call it a bro@@ w@@ ser ; it &apos;s really not a bro@@ w@@ ser , but you can view we@@ b p@@ ages with it -- and we bring that zo@@ om@@ able technology to every single we@@ b page like this .
So I can step back , po@@ p right back into a speci@@ fic sec@@ tion .
Now the reason why this is important is because , by vir@@ tu@@ e of just vie@@ wing we@@ b p@@ ages in this way , I can look at my entire bro@@ w@@ sing history in the ex@@ act same way .
So I can dri@@ ll into what I &apos;ve done over speci@@ fic time fra@@ m@@ es .
Here , in fact , is the state of all the dem@@ o that I just gave .
And I can sort of re@@ play some stuff that I was looking at ear@@ li@@ er today .
And , if I want to step back and look at everything , I can sli@@ ce and di@@ ce my history , perhaps by my sear@@ ch history -- here , I was doing some ne@@ po@@ tisti@@ c sear@@ ching , looking for B@@ ing , over here for Li@@ ve Lab@@ s Pi@@ v@@ ot .
And from these , I can dri@@ ll into the we@@ b page and just la@@ unch them again .
It &apos;s one metap@@ h@@ or re@@ pur@@ pos@@ ed multi@@ ple times , and in each case it makes the whole gre@@ ater than the s@@ um of the parts with the data .
So right now , in this world , we think about data as being this cur@@ se .
We talk about the cur@@ se of information over@@ lo@@ ad .
We talk about dro@@ w@@ ning in data .
What if we can actually turn that up@@ side down and turn the we@@ b up@@ side down , so that instead of n@@ avi@@ g@@ ating from one thing to the next , we get used to the hab@@ it of being able to go from many things to many things , and then being able to see the patterns that were o@@ ther@@ wise hi@@ d@@ den ?
If we can do that , then instead of being tr@@ app@@ ed in data , we might actually extra@@ ct information .
And , instead of de@@ aling just with information , we can te@@ ase out knowledge .
And if we get the knowledge , then maybe even there &apos;s wis@@ dom to be found .
So with that , I thank you .
Every@@ body talks about happiness these days .
I had somebody coun@@ t the number of books with &quot; happiness &quot; in the tit@@ le publi@@ shed in the last five years and they gave up after about 40 , and there were many more .
There is a huge wa@@ ve of interest in happiness , am@@ ong resear@@ ch@@ ers .
There is a lot of happiness co@@ ach@@ ing .
Every@@ body would like to make people happ@@ ier .
But in spi@@ te of all this flo@@ od of work , there are several c@@ ogni@@ tive tr@@ aps that sort of make it almost impossible to think stra@@ ight about happiness .
And my talk today will be mos@@ tly about these c@@ ogni@@ tive tr@@ aps .
This app@@ lies to la@@ y@@ people thinking about their own happiness , and it app@@ lies to sch@@ ol@@ ars thinking about happiness , because it turns out we &apos;re just as m@@ ess@@ ed up as anybody else is .
The first of these tr@@ aps is a rel@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ ance to ad@@ mit comple@@ x@@ ity .
It turns out that the word &quot; happiness &quot; is just not a us@@ eful word any@@ more , because we app@@ ly it to too many different things .
I think there is one particular meaning to which we might res@@ tri@@ ct it , but by and large , this is something that we &apos;ll have to give up and we &apos;ll have to ad@@ op@@ t the more complic@@ ated view of what well@@ -@@ being is .
The second tra@@ p is a conf@@ usion between experience and mem@@ ory ; basically , it &apos;s between being happy in your life , and being happy about your life or happy with your life .
And those are two very different conc@@ ep@@ ts , and they &apos;re both l@@ ump@@ ed in the no@@ tion of happiness .
And the third is the foc@@ using ill@@ usion , and it &apos;s the un@@ fortun@@ ate fact that we can &apos;t think about any cir@@ c@@ um@@ st@@ ance that aff@@ ects well@@ -@@ being without dis@@ tor@@ ting its import@@ ance .
I mean , this is a real c@@ ogni@@ tive tra@@ p .
There &apos;s just no way of getting it right .
Now , I &apos;d like to start with an example of somebody who had a ques@@ tion@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ answer s@@ es@@ sion after one of my lec@@ tures re@@ por@@ ted a story , and that was a story -- He said he &apos;d been list@@ ening to a sym@@ ph@@ ony , and it was absolutely gl@@ ori@@ ous music and at the very end of the rec@@ or@@ ding , there was a dre@@ ad@@ ful scre@@ e@@ ching sound .
And then he ad@@ ded , really quite emo@@ tion@@ ally , it ru@@ ined the whole experience .
But it ha@@ dn &apos;t .
What it had ru@@ ined were the mem@@ ories of the experience .
He had had the experience .
He had had 20 minutes of gl@@ ori@@ ous music .
They coun@@ ted for nothing because he was left with a mem@@ ory ; the mem@@ ory was ru@@ ined , and the mem@@ ory was all that he had got@@ ten to keep .
What this is telling us , really , is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves .
There is an experi@@ en@@ cing self , who lives in the present and knows the present , is cap@@ able of re-@@ living the past , but basically it has only the present .
It &apos;s the experi@@ en@@ cing self that the doc@@ tor appro@@ ach@@ es -- you know , when the doc@@ tor as@@ ks , &quot; Do@@ es it h@@ urt now when I tou@@ ch you here ? &quot;
And then there is a remem@@ ber@@ ing self , and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self is the one that ke@@ ep@@ s sc@@ ore , and main@@ ta@@ ins the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the doc@@ tor appro@@ ach@@ es in asking the question , &quot; How have you been feeling l@@ ately ? &quot;
or &quot; How was your tri@@ p to Al@@ b@@ ani@@ a ? &quot; or something like that .
Those are two very different enti@@ ties , the experi@@ en@@ cing self and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , and getting conf@@ used between them is part of the m@@ ess about the no@@ tion of happiness .
Now , the remem@@ ber@@ ing self is a stor@@ y@@ tell@@ er .
And that really starts with a basic response of our mem@@ ories -- it starts immedi@@ ately .
We don &apos;t only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
Our mem@@ ory tells us stories , that is , what we get to keep from our experi@@ ences is a story .
And let me begin with one example .
This is an old study .
Those are ac@@ tual patients under@@ going a pain@@ ful pro@@ ce@@ d@@ ure .
I won &apos;t go into de@@ tail . It &apos;s no longer pain@@ ful these days , but it was pain@@ ful when this study was run in the 199@@ 0s .
They were asked to rep@@ ort on their pa@@ in every 60 secon@@ ds .
Here are two patients , those are their rec@@ ord@@ ings .
And you are asked , &quot; Who of them suff@@ er@@ ed more ? &quot;
And it &apos;s a very easy question .
C@@ lear@@ ly , Pati@@ ent B suff@@ er@@ ed more -- his col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y was longer , and every minute of pa@@ in that Pati@@ ent A had , Pati@@ ent B had , and more .
But now there is another question : &quot; How much did these patients think they suff@@ er@@ ed ? &quot;
And here is a sur@@ pr@@ ise .
The sur@@ pr@@ ise is that Pati@@ ent A had a much wor@@ se mem@@ ory of the col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y than Pati@@ ent B .
The stories of the col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ ies were different , and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends .
And nei@@ ther of these stories is very in@@ spir@@ ing or great -- but one of them is this dis@@ tin@@ ct ... but one of them is dis@@ tin@@ c@@ tly wor@@ se than the other .
And the one that is wor@@ se is the one where pa@@ in was at its pe@@ ak at the very end ; it &apos;s a bad story .
How do we know that ?
Because we asked these people after their col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y , and much later , too , &quot; How bad was the whole thing , in total ? &quot;
And it was much wor@@ se for A than for B , in mem@@ ory .
Now this is a direc@@ t conf@@ lic@@ t between the experi@@ en@@ cing self and the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
F@@ rom the point of view of the experi@@ en@@ cing self , clear@@ ly , B had a wor@@ se time .
Now , what you could do with Pati@@ ent A , and we actually r@@ an c@@ lin@@ ical experim@@ ents , and it has been done , and it does work -- you could actually ex@@ tend the col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ y of Pati@@ ent A by just ke@@ ep@@ ing the tu@@ be in without j@@ ig@@ gl@@ ing it too much .
That will cause the patient to suff@@ er , but just a little and much less than before .
And if you do that for a couple of minutes , you have made the experi@@ en@@ cing self of Pati@@ ent A wor@@ se off , and you have the remem@@ ber@@ ing self of Pati@@ ent A a lot better off , because now you have en@@ do@@ wed Pati@@ ent A with a better story about his experience .
What defin@@ es a story ?
And that is true of the stories that mem@@ ory deli@@ vers for us , and it &apos;s also true of the stories that we make up .
What defin@@ es a story are changes , signific@@ ant mom@@ ents and end@@ ings .
En@@ dings are very , very important and , in this case , the ending dom@@ in@@ ated .
Now , the experi@@ en@@ cing self lives its life continu@@ ously .
It has mom@@ ents of experience , one after the other .
And you can ask : What happens to these mom@@ ents ?
And the answer is really stra@@ i@@ gh@@ t@@ forward : They are lost for@@ ever .
I mean , most of the mom@@ ents of our life -- and I calcul@@ ated , you know , the psych@@ ological present is said to be about three secon@@ ds long ; that means that , you know , in a life there are about 600 million of them ; in a month , there are about 6@@ 00@@ ,000 -- most of them don &apos;t leave a tra@@ ce .
Most of them are completely ignor@@ ed by the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
And yet , somehow you get the sense that they should coun@@ t , that what happens during these mom@@ ents of experience is our life .
It &apos;s the fin@@ ite res@@ ource that we &apos;re sp@@ ending while we &apos;re on this earth .
And how to spend it would seem to be rel@@ ev@@ ant , but that is not the story that the remem@@ ber@@ ing self ke@@ ep@@ s for us .
So we have the remem@@ ber@@ ing self and the experi@@ en@@ cing self , and they &apos;re really quite dis@@ tin@@ ct .
The biggest difference between them is in the hand@@ ling of time .
F@@ rom the point of view of the experi@@ en@@ cing self , if you have a v@@ ac@@ ation , and the second week is just as good as the first , then the t@@ wo@@ -@@ week v@@ ac@@ ation is t@@ wi@@ ce as good as the one-@@ week v@@ ac@@ ation .
That &apos;s not the way it works at all for the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
For the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , a t@@ wo@@ -@@ week v@@ ac@@ ation is bar@@ ely better than the one-@@ week v@@ ac@@ ation because there are no new mem@@ ories ad@@ ded .
You have not changed the story .
And in this way , time is actually the critical vari@@ able that dist@@ ing@@ u@@ ish@@ es a remem@@ ber@@ ing self from an experi@@ en@@ cing self ; time has very little impact on the story .
Now , the remem@@ ber@@ ing self does more than remember and tell stories .
It is actually the one that makes dec@@ isions because , if you have a patient who has had , say , two col@@ on@@ os@@ cop@@ ies with two different sur@@ ge@@ ons and is deci@@ ding which of them to cho@@ ose , then the one that cho@@ os@@ es is the one that has the mem@@ ory that is less bad , and that &apos;s the sur@@ ge@@ on that will be ch@@ os@@ en .
The experi@@ en@@ cing self has no vo@@ ice in this choice .
We actually don &apos;t cho@@ ose between experi@@ ences , we cho@@ ose between mem@@ ories of experi@@ ences .
And even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future norm@@ ally as experi@@ ences .
We think of our future as anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated mem@@ ories .
And basically you can look at this , you know , as a ty@@ ran@@ ny of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , and you can think of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self sort of dra@@ g@@ ging the experi@@ en@@ cing self through experi@@ ences that the experi@@ en@@ cing self doesn &apos;t need .
I have that sense that when we go on v@@ ac@@ ations this is very fre@@ qu@@ ently the case ; that is , we go on v@@ ac@@ ations , to a very large ex@@ t@@ ent , in the service of our remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
And this is a bit hard to j@@ us@@ ti@@ fy I think .
I mean , how much do we consu@@ me our mem@@ ories ?
That is one of the ex@@ plan@@ ations that is given for the dom@@ in@@ ance of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self .
And when I think about that , I think about a v@@ ac@@ ation we had in Ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic@@ a a few years ago , which was clear@@ ly the best v@@ ac@@ ation I &apos;ve ever had , and I think of it rel@@ ativ@@ ely often , rel@@ ative to how much I think of other v@@ ac@@ ations .
And I probably have con@@ sum@@ ed my mem@@ ories of that thre@@ e-@@ week tri@@ p , I would say , for about 25 minutes in the last four years .
Now , if I had ever open@@ ed the fol@@ der with the 600 pictures in it , I would have spent another hour .
Now , that is three weeks , and that is at most an hour and a half .
There seems to be a dis@@ cre@@ pan@@ cy .
Now , I may be a bit extre@@ me , you know , in how little appe@@ ti@@ te I have for con@@ sum@@ ing mem@@ ories , but even if you do more of this , there is a gen@@ u@@ ine question : Why do we put so much wei@@ ght on mem@@ ory rel@@ ative to the wei@@ ght that we put on experi@@ ences ?
So I want you to think about a thought experiment .
I@@ mag@@ ine that for your next v@@ ac@@ ation , you know that at the end of the v@@ ac@@ ation all your pictures will be des@@ tro@@ yed , and you &apos;ll get an am@@ n@@ es@@ ic dru@@ g so that you won &apos;t remember anything .
Now , would you cho@@ ose the same v@@ ac@@ ation ? And if you would cho@@ ose a different v@@ ac@@ ation , there is a conf@@ lic@@ t between your two selves , and you need to think about how to ad@@ ju@@ dic@@ ate that conf@@ lic@@ t , and it &apos;s actually not at all obvi@@ ous , because if you think in terms of time , then you get one answer , and if you think in terms of mem@@ ories , you might get another answer .
Why do we pick the v@@ ac@@ ations we do is a problem that con@@ fron@@ ts us with a choice between the two selves .
Now , the two selves bring up two no@@ tions of happiness .
There are really two conc@@ ep@@ ts of happiness that we can app@@ ly , one per self .
So you can ask : How happy is the experi@@ en@@ cing self ?
And then you would ask : How happy are the mom@@ ents in the experi@@ en@@ cing self &apos;s life ?
And they &apos;re all -- happiness for mom@@ ents is a fa@@ ir@@ ly complic@@ ated process .
What are the emo@@ tions that can be meas@@ ured ?
And , by the way , now we are cap@@ able of getting a pretty good idea of the happiness of the experi@@ en@@ cing self over time .
If you ask for the happiness of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , it &apos;s a completely different thing .
This is not about how happ@@ ily a person lives .
It is about how sa@@ tis@@ fied or pleas@@ ed the person is when that person thin@@ ks about her life .
Ver@@ y different no@@ tion .
Any@@ one who doesn &apos;t dist@@ ing@@ u@@ ish those no@@ tions is going to m@@ ess up the study of happiness , and I bel@@ ong to a cro@@ w@@ d of students of well@@ -@@ being , who &apos;ve been m@@ ess@@ ing up the study of happiness for a long time in pre@@ cis@@ ely this way .
The dis@@ tin@@ ction between the happiness of the experi@@ en@@ cing self and the sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ tion of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self has been recogni@@ zed in rec@@ ent years , and there are now eff@@ or@@ ts to measure the two separ@@ ately .
The G@@ all@@ up Organ@@ i@@ zation has a world pol@@ l where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experi@@ ences , and there have been other eff@@ or@@ ts along those lines .
So in rec@@ ent years , we have beg@@ un to learn about the happiness of the two selves .
And the main less@@ on I think that we have learned is they are really different .
You can know how sa@@ tis@@ fied somebody is with their life , and that really doesn &apos;t teach you much about how happ@@ ily they &apos;re living their life , and vice vers@@ a .
Just to give you a sense of the cor@@ rel@@ ation , the cor@@ rel@@ ation is about .@@ 5 .
What that means is if you met somebody , and you were told , &quot; Oh his father is six feet t@@ all , &quot; how much would you know about his hei@@ ght ?
Well , you would know something about his hei@@ ght , but there &apos;s a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty .
You have that much un@@ certain@@ ty .
If I tell you that somebody ran@@ ked their life eight on a scale of ten , you have a lot of un@@ certain@@ ty about how happy they are with their experi@@ en@@ cing self .
So the cor@@ rel@@ ation is low .
We know something about what contro@@ ls sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ tion of the happiness self .
We know that money is very important , go@@ als are very important .
We know that happiness is main@@ ly being sa@@ tis@@ fied with people that we like , sp@@ ending time with people that we like .
There are other pleas@@ ures , but this is dom@@ in@@ ant .
So if you want to ma@@ x@@ im@@ i@@ ze the happiness of the two selves , you are going to end up doing very different things .
The bottom line of what I &apos;ve said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a sub@@ stitu@@ te for well@@ -@@ being .
It is a completely different no@@ tion .
Now , very quickly , another reason we cannot think stra@@ ight about happiness is that we do not att@@ end to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live .
So , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in C@@ aliforni@@ a , you are not going to get to the cor@@ rec@@ t answer .
When you ask that question , you think people must be happ@@ ier in C@@ aliforni@@ a if , say , you live in O@@ hi@@ o .
And what happens is when you think about living in C@@ aliforni@@ a , you are thinking of the con@@ tr@@ ast between C@@ aliforni@@ a and other places , and that con@@ tr@@ ast , say , is in climate .
Well , it turns out that climate is not very important to the experi@@ en@@ cing self and it &apos;s not even very important to the ref@@ lec@@ tive self that deci@@ des how happy people are .
But now , because the ref@@ lec@@ tive self is in char@@ ge , you may end up -- some people may end up moving to C@@ aliforni@@ a .
And it &apos;s sort of interesting to tra@@ ce what is going to happen to people who move to C@@ aliforni@@ a in the hope of getting happ@@ ier .
Well , their experi@@ en@@ cing self is not going to get happ@@ ier .
We know that .
But one thing will happen : They will think they are happ@@ ier , because , when they think about it , they &apos;ll be re@@ min@@ ded of how hor@@ ri@@ ble the we@@ a@@ ther was in O@@ hi@@ o , and they will feel they made the right dec@@ ision .
It is very difficult to think stra@@ ight about well@@ -@@ being , and I hope I have given you a sense of how difficult it is .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you . I &apos;ve got a question for you .
Thank you so much .
Now , when we were on the phone a few weeks ago , you men@@ tion@@ ed to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that G@@ all@@ up sur@@ v@@ ey .
Is that something you can share since you do have a few mom@@ ents left now ?
D@@ ani@@ el K@@ ah@@ ne@@ man : S@@ ure .
I think the most interesting result that we found in the G@@ all@@ up sur@@ v@@ ey is a number , which we absolutely did not expect to find .
We found that with res@@ pect to the happiness of the experi@@ en@@ cing self .
When we looked at how feel@@ ings , v@@ ary with in@@ come .
And it turns out that , bel@@ ow an in@@ come of 6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , for Americ@@ ans -- and that &apos;s a very large sam@@ ple of Americ@@ ans , like 6@@ 00@@ ,000 , so it &apos;s a large repres@@ ent@@ ative sam@@ ple -- bel@@ ow an in@@ come of 6@@ 00@@ ,000 dollars a year ...
CA : 6@@ 0,000 .
D@@ K : 6@@ 0,000 .
6@@ 0,000 dollars a year , people are un@@ happy , and they get pro@@ gres@@ si@@ v@@ ely un@@ happ@@ ier the po@@ or@@ er they get .
A@@ bo@@ ve that , we get an absolutely fl@@ at line .
I mean I &apos;ve r@@ ar@@ ely seen lines so fl@@ at .
C@@ lear@@ ly , what is happening is money does not buy you experi@@ ential happiness , but l@@ ack of money certainly bu@@ ys you mis@@ er@@ y , and we can measure that mis@@ er@@ y very , very clear@@ ly .
In terms of the other self , the remem@@ ber@@ ing self , you get a different story .
The more money you ear@@ n , the more sa@@ tis@@ fied you are .
That does not hold for emo@@ tions .
CA : But Dan@@ ny , the whole American en@@ de@@ a@@ vor is about life , li@@ ber@@ ty , the pur@@ su@@ it of happiness .
If people took seri@@ ously that fin@@ ding , I mean , it seems to turn up@@ side down everything we believe about , like for example , ta@@ x@@ ation polic@@ y and so for@@ th .
Is there any chance that poli@@ tici@@ ans , that the country gener@@ ally , would take a fin@@ ding like that seri@@ ously and run public polic@@ y based on it ?
D@@ K : You know I think that there is recogni@@ tion of the ro@@ le of happiness research in public polic@@ y .
The recogni@@ tion is going to be s@@ low in the United States , no question about that , but in the U.@@ K@@ . , it is happening , and in other countries it is happening .
People are recogni@@ zing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public polic@@ y .
It &apos;s going to take a while , and people are going to de@@ b@@ ate whether they want to study experience happiness , or whether they want to study life ev@@ al@@ uation , so we need to have that de@@ b@@ ate fa@@ ir@@ ly soon .
How to en@@ h@@ ance happiness goes very different ways dep@@ ending on how you think , and whether you think of the remem@@ ber@@ ing self or you think of the experi@@ en@@ cing self .
This is going to influ@@ ence polic@@ y , I think , in years to come .
In the United States , eff@@ or@@ ts are being made to measure the experience happiness of the population .
This is going to be , I think , within the next dec@@ ade or two , part of national statisti@@ cs .
CA : Well , it seems to me that this issue will -- or at least should be -- the most interesting polic@@ y disc@@ us@@ sion to tra@@ ck over the next few years .
Thank you so much for inv@@ ent@@ ing behavi@@ or@@ al econom@@ ics .
Thank you , Dan@@ ny K@@ ah@@ ne@@ man .
I &apos;m going to talk today about energy and climate .
And that might seem a bit surpris@@ ing because my f@@ ull@@ -@@ time work at the F@@ oun@@ dation is mos@@ tly about v@@ acc@@ ines and se@@ e@@ ds , about the things that we need to inv@@ ent and deli@@ ver to help the po@@ or@@ est two billion live better lives .
But energy and climate are extremely important to these people -- in fact , more important than to anyone else on the planet .
The climate getting wor@@ se means that many years , their cro@@ ps won &apos;t grow : There will be too much ra@@ in , not enough ra@@ in , things will change in ways that their fra@@ gi@@ le environment simply can &apos;t support .
And that lea@@ ds to star@@ v@@ ation , it lea@@ ds to un@@ certain@@ ty , it lea@@ ds to un@@ rest .
So , the climate changes will be terri@@ ble for them .
Also , the price of energy is very important to them .
In fact , if you could pick just one thing to lower the price of , to redu@@ ce poverty , by far you would pick energy .
Now , the price of energy has come down over time .
Re@@ ally advan@@ ced ci@@ vili@@ zation is based on advan@@ ces in energy .
The co@@ al re@@ volution fu@@ el@@ ed the Indu@@ stri@@ al Revolution , and , even in the 19@@ 0@@ 0s we &apos;ve seen a very rap@@ id de@@ cl@@ ine in the price of electri@@ city , and that &apos;s why we have re@@ fri@@ ger@@ ators , air@@ -@@ condi@@ tion@@ ing , we can make modern materials and do so many things .
And so , we &apos;re in a wonderful situation with electri@@ city in the rich world .
But , as we make it che@@ aper -- and let &apos;s go for making it t@@ wi@@ ce as che@@ ap -- we need to meet a new con@@ stra@@ int , and that con@@ stra@@ int has to do with CO2 .
CO2 is war@@ ming the planet , and the equ@@ ation on CO2 is actually a very stra@@ i@@ gh@@ t@@ forward one .
If you s@@ um up the CO2 that gets em@@ it@@ ted , that lea@@ ds to a temper@@ ature incre@@ ase , and that temper@@ ature incre@@ ase lea@@ ds to some very neg@@ ative eff@@ ects : the eff@@ ects on the we@@ a@@ ther ; perhaps wor@@ se , the indi@@ rec@@ t eff@@ ects , in that the natural ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem@@ s can &apos;t ad@@ just to these rap@@ id changes , and so you get ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem coll@@ ap@@ ses .
Now , the ex@@ act amount of how you map from a certain incre@@ ase of CO2 to what temper@@ ature will be and where the positive fe@@ ed@@ bac@@ ks are , there &apos;s some un@@ certain@@ ty there , but not very much .
And there &apos;s certainly un@@ certain@@ ty about how bad those eff@@ ects will be , but they will be extremely bad .
I asked the top scientists on this several times : Do we really have to get down to ne@@ ar zer@@ o ?
Can &apos;t we just cut it in half or a quar@@ ter ?
And the answer is that until we get ne@@ ar to zer@@ o , the temper@@ ature will continue to rise .
And so that &apos;s a big challenge .
It &apos;s very different than saying &quot; We &apos;re a t@@ wel@@ v@@ e-@@ fo@@ ot@@ -@@ high tru@@ ck trying to get under a ten@@ -@@ foot bridge , and we can just sort of squ@@ e@@ e@@ ze under . &quot;
This is something that has to get to zer@@ o .
Now , we put out a lot of carbon di@@ ox@@ i@@ de every year , over 2@@ 6 billion t@@ ons .
For each American , it &apos;s about 20 t@@ ons ; for people in poor countries , it &apos;s less than one ton .
It &apos;s an average of about five t@@ ons for everyone on the planet .
And , somehow , we have to make changes that will bring that down to zer@@ o .
It &apos;s been con@@ st@@ antly going up .
It &apos;s only vari@@ ous economic changes that have even fl@@ atten@@ ed it at all , so we have to go from rap@@ i@@ dly ris@@ ing to fall@@ ing , and fall@@ ing all the way to zer@@ o .
This equ@@ ation has four fac@@ tors , a little bit of multi@@ p@@ lic@@ ation : So , you &apos;ve got a thing on the left , CO2 , that you want to get to zer@@ o , and that &apos;s going to be based on the number of people , the ser@@ vices each person &apos;s using on average , the energy on average for each service , and the CO2 being put out per un@@ it of energy .
So , let &apos;s look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zer@@ o .
Pro@@ bab@@ ly , one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty ne@@ ar to zer@@ o .
Now that &apos;s back from high school al@@ ge@@ br@@ a , but let &apos;s take a look .
First , we &apos;ve got population .
The world today has 6@@ .@@ 8 billion people .
That &apos;s head@@ ed up to about nine billion .
Now , if we do a really great job on new v@@ acc@@ ines , health care , re@@ produc@@ tive health ser@@ vices , we could lower that by , perhaps , 10 or 15 percent , but there we see an incre@@ ase of about 1@@ .@@ 3 .
The second fac@@ tor is the ser@@ vices we use .
This en@@ comp@@ asses everything : the food we eat , clo@@ thing , TV , he@@ ating .
These are very good things : getting ri@@ d of poverty means provi@@ ding these ser@@ vices to almost everyone on the planet .
And it &apos;s a great thing for this number to go up .
In the rich world , perhaps the top one billion , we probably could cut back and use less , but every year , this number , on average , is going to go up , and so , over all , that will more than dou@@ ble the ser@@ vices deli@@ vered per person .
Here we have a very basic service : Do you have ligh@@ ting in your house to be able to read your h@@ ome@@ work ?
And , in fact , these kids don &apos;t , so they &apos;re going out and read@@ ing their school work under the street l@@ am@@ ps .
Now , effici@@ ency , E , the energy for each service , here finally we have some good news .
We have something that &apos;s not going up .
Th@@ r@@ ough vari@@ ous inv@@ en@@ tions and new ways of doing ligh@@ ting , through different typ@@ es of cars , different ways of building buildings -- there are a lot of ser@@ vices where you can bring the energy for that service down quite sub@@ st@@ anti@@ ally .
Some individual ser@@ vices even bring it down by 90 percent .
There are other ser@@ vices like how we make fer@@ ti@@ li@@ zer , or how we do air transp@@ ort , where the ro@@ oms for impro@@ v@@ ement are far , far less .
And so , over@@ all here , if we &apos;re op@@ tim@@ is@@ tic , we may get a re@@ duc@@ tion of a fac@@ tor of three to even , perhaps , a fac@@ tor of six .
But for these first three fac@@ tors now , we &apos;ve gone from 2@@ 6 billion to , at best , maybe 13 billion t@@ ons , and that just won &apos;t cut it .
So let &apos;s look at this f@@ our@@ th fac@@ tor -- this is going to be a key one -- and this is the amount of CO2 put out per each un@@ it of energy .
And so the question is : Can you actually get that to zer@@ o ?
If you bur@@ n co@@ al , no .
If you bur@@ n natural gas , no .
Al@@ most every way we make electri@@ city today , except for the em@@ erg@@ ing ren@@ e@@ w@@ ab@@ les and nuclear , pu@@ ts out CO2 .
And so , what we &apos;re going to have to do at a global scale , is create a new system .
And so , we need energy mi@@ ra@@ cles .
Now , when I use the term &quot; mi@@ ra@@ cle , &quot; I don &apos;t mean something that &apos;s impossible .
The micro@@ process@@ or is a mi@@ ra@@ cle . The personal computer is a mi@@ ra@@ cle .
The Internet and its ser@@ vices are a mi@@ ra@@ cle .
So , the people here have par@@ tici@@ p@@ ated in the cre@@ ation of many mi@@ ra@@ cles .
U@@ su@@ ally , we don &apos;t have a de@@ ad@@ line , where you have to get the mi@@ ra@@ cle by a certain da@@ te .
U@@ su@@ ally , you just kind of stand by , and some come along , some don &apos;t .
This is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a mi@@ ra@@ cle in a pretty ti@@ ght tim@@ el@@ ine .
Now , I thought , &quot; How could I really cap@@ ture this ?
Is there some kind of natural il@@ lu@@ stra@@ tion , some demon@@ stra@@ tion that would gra@@ b people &apos;s imag@@ in@@ ation here ? &quot;
I thought back to a year ago when I brought mos@@ qu@@ it@@ os , and somehow people en@@ jo@@ yed that .
It really got them involved in the idea of , you know , there are people who live with mos@@ qu@@ it@@ os .
So , with energy , all I could come up with is this .
I decided that rel@@ eas@@ ing fi@@ re@@ fli@@ es would be my con@@ tribu@@ tion to the environment here this year .
So here we have some natural fi@@ re@@ fli@@ es .
I &apos;m told they don &apos;t bi@@ te ; in fact , they might not even leave that j@@ ar .
Now , there &apos;s all sorts of gi@@ m@@ mi@@ cky sol@@ utions like that one , but they don &apos;t really add up to much .
We need sol@@ utions -- either one or several -- that have unbe@@ liev@@ able scale and unbe@@ liev@@ able re@@ li@@ ability , and , al@@ though there &apos;s many direc@@ tions people are se@@ e@@ king , I really only see five that can ach@@ ie@@ ve the big numbers .
I &apos;ve left out ti@@ de , ge@@ o@@ ther@@ mal , f@@ usion , bio@@ fu@@ els .
Those may make some con@@ tribu@@ tion , and if they can do better than I expect , so much the better , but my key point here is that we &apos;re going to have to work on each of these five , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because they look da@@ un@@ ting , because they all have signific@@ ant challen@@ ges .
Let &apos;s look first at the bur@@ ning f@@ os@@ si@@ l fu@@ els , either bur@@ ning co@@ al or bur@@ ning natural gas .
What you need to do there , seems like it might be simple , but it &apos;s not , and that &apos;s to take all the CO2 , after you &apos;ve bur@@ ned it , going out the flu@@ e , pres@@ su@@ ri@@ ze it , create a li@@ qu@@ id , put it somewhere , and hope it sta@@ ys there .
Now we have some p@@ il@@ ot things that do this at the 60 to 80 percent level , but getting up to that full perc@@ ent@@ age , that will be very tri@@ cky , and ag@@ re@@ eing on where these CO2 qu@@ anti@@ ties should be put will be hard , but the t@@ ough@@ est one here is this lon@@ g-@@ term issue .
Who &apos;s going to be sure ?
Who &apos;s going to gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e something that is literally billi@@ ons of times larger than any type of wa@@ ste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things ?
This is a lot of vol@@ u@@ me .
So that &apos;s a t@@ ough one .
N@@ ex@@ t would be nuclear .
It also has three big problems : C@@ ost , particularly in high@@ ly reg@@ ul@@ ated countries , is high ; the issue of the sa@@ f@@ ety , really feeling good about nothing could go wrong , that , even though you have these human oper@@ ators , that the fu@@ el doesn &apos;t get used for we@@ ap@@ ons .
And then what do you do with the wa@@ ste ?
And , al@@ though it &apos;s not very large , there are a lot of con@@ cer@@ ns about that .
People need to feel good about it .
So three very t@@ ough problems that might be sol@@ v@@ able , and so , should be worked on .
The last three of the five , I &apos;ve grou@@ p@@ ed together .
These are what people often re@@ fer to as the ren@@ e@@ w@@ able s@@ ources .
And they actually -- al@@ though it &apos;s great they don &apos;t re@@ qu@@ ire fu@@ el -- they have some dis@@ advan@@ ta@@ ges .
One is that the den@@ s@@ ity of energy ga@@ ther@@ ed in these technologies is drama@@ tically less than a power plant .
This is energy far@@ ming , so you &apos;re talking about many squ@@ are miles , thousands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant .
Also , these are inter@@ mitt@@ ent s@@ ources .
The sun doesn &apos;t sh@@ ine all day , it doesn &apos;t sh@@ ine every day , and , li@@ ke@@ wise , the wind doesn &apos;t b@@ low all the time .
And so , if you dep@@ end on these s@@ ources , you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time peri@@ o@@ ds that it &apos;s not available .
So , we &apos;ve got big cost challen@@ ges here , we have trans@@ mission challen@@ ges : for example , say this energy source is outside your country ; you not only need the technology , but you have to deal with the risk of the energy coming from el@@ se@@ where .
And , finally , this stor@@ age problem .
And , to dimension@@ ali@@ ze this , I went through and looked at all the typ@@ es of bat@@ ter@@ ies that get made -- for cars , for computers , for ph@@ ones , for fl@@ ash@@ li@@ ghts , for everything -- and compar@@ ed that to the amount of electri@@ cal energy the world uses , and what I found is that all the bat@@ ter@@ ies we make now could st@@ ore less than 10 minutes of all the energy .
And so , in fact , we need a big bre@@ ak@@ through here , something that &apos;s going to be a fac@@ tor of 100 better than the appro@@ ach@@ es we have now .
It &apos;s not impossible , but it &apos;s not a very easy thing .
Now , this shows up when you try to get the inter@@ mitt@@ ent source to be above , say , 20 to 30 percent of what you &apos;re using .
If you &apos;re coun@@ ting on it for 100 percent , you need an incredible mi@@ ra@@ cle bat@@ ter@@ y .
Now , how we &apos;re going to go forward on this -- what &apos;s the right approach ?
Is it a Man@@ hat@@ t@@ an Pro@@ ject ? What &apos;s the thing that can get us there ?
Well , we need lots of companies working on this , hundreds .
In each of these five pa@@ ths , we need at least a hundred people .
And a lot of them , you &apos;ll look at and say , &quot; They &apos;re cra@@ zy . &quot; That &apos;s good .
And , I think , here in the TED group , we have many people who are already pur@@ su@@ ing this .
Bill Gr@@ os@@ s has several companies , inclu@@ ding one called e@@ Sol@@ ar that has some great solar ther@@ mal technologies .
V@@ in@@ od K@@ h@@ os@@ la &apos;s inves@@ ting in do@@ z@@ ens of companies that are doing great things and have interesting possi@@ bili@@ ties , and I &apos;m trying to help back that .
Na@@ than My@@ hr@@ v@@ old and I actually are bac@@ king a company that , perhaps surpris@@ ingly , is actually taking the nuclear approach .
There are some innov@@ ations in nuclear : mod@@ ular , li@@ qu@@ id .
And innovation really stopp@@ ed in this industry quite some ago , so the idea that there &apos;s some good ideas la@@ ying around is not all that surpris@@ ing .
The idea of Ter@@ ra@@ Po@@ wer is that , instead of bur@@ ning a part of ur@@ ani@@ um -- the one percent , which is the U@@ 2@@ 35 -- we decided , &quot; Let &apos;s bur@@ n the 99 percent , the U@@ 2@@ 3@@ 8 . &quot;
It is kind of a cra@@ zy idea .
In fact , people had talked about it for a long time , but they could never sim@@ ul@@ ate proper@@ ly whether it would work or not , and so it &apos;s through the ad@@ v@@ ent of modern super@@ computers that now you can sim@@ ul@@ ate and see that , yes , with the right material &apos;s approach , this looks like it would work .
And , because you &apos;re bur@@ ning that 99 percent , you have great@@ ly impro@@ ved cost pro@@ fi@@ le .
You actually bur@@ n up the wa@@ ste , and you can actually use as fu@@ el all the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver wa@@ ste from today &apos;s re@@ ac@@ tors .
So , instead of wor@@ r@@ ying about them , you just take that . It &apos;s a great thing .
It brea@@ th@@ es this ur@@ ani@@ um as it goes along , so it &apos;s kind of like a c@@ and@@ le .
You can see it &apos;s a lo@@ g there , often re@@ fer@@ red to as a tra@@ vel@@ ing wa@@ ve re@@ ac@@ tor .
In terms of fu@@ el , this really sol@@ ves the problem .
I &apos;ve got a picture here of a place in K@@ ent@@ u@@ cky .
This is the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver , the 99 percent , where they &apos;ve taken out the part they bur@@ n now , so it &apos;s called de@@ ple@@ ted ur@@ ani@@ um .
That would power the U.S. for hundreds of years .
And , simply by fil@@ ter@@ ing se@@ a@@ water in an in@@ exp@@ ensive process , you &apos;d have enough fu@@ el for the entire li@@ fe@@ time of the rest of the planet .
So , you know , it &apos;s got lots of challen@@ ges ah@@ ead , but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward .
So let &apos;s think : How should we measure ourselves ?
What should our rep@@ ort car@@ d look like ?
Well , let &apos;s go out to where we really need to get , and then look at the inter@@ medi@@ ate .
For 20@@ 50 , you &apos;ve heard many people talk about this 80 percent re@@ duc@@ tion .
That really is very important , that we get there .
And that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries , still some ag@@ ri@@ culture , hop@@ efully we will have cle@@ an@@ ed up for@@ es@@ try , c@@ ement .
So , to get to that 80 percent , the developed countries , inclu@@ ding countries like China , will have had to s@@ wit@@ ch their electri@@ city generation al@@ together .
So , the other gra@@ de is : A@@ re we dep@@ lo@@ ying this zer@@ o-@@ emis@@ sion technology , have we dep@@ lo@@ yed it in all the developed countries and we &apos;re in the process of getting it el@@ se@@ where ?
That &apos;s su@@ per important .
That &apos;s a key el@@ ement of making that rep@@ ort car@@ d .
So , bac@@ king up from there , what should the 20@@ 20 rep@@ ort car@@ d look like ?
Well , again , it should have the two el@@ ements .
We should go through these effici@@ ency meas@@ ures to start getting re@@ duc@@ tions : The less we em@@ it , the less that s@@ um will be of CO2 , and , there@@ fore , the less the temper@@ ature .
But in some ways , the gra@@ de we get there , doing things that don &apos;t get us all the way to the big re@@ duc@@ tions , is only equ@@ ally , or maybe even sli@@ gh@@ tly less , important than the other , which is the piece of innovation on these bre@@ ak@@ thr@@ ough@@ s .
These bre@@ ak@@ thr@@ ough@@ s , we need to move those at full speed , and we can measure that in terms of companies , p@@ il@@ ot projects , reg@@ ul@@ at@@ ory things that have been changed .
There &apos;s a lot of great books that have been w@@ ritten about this .
The Al G@@ ore book , &quot; Our C@@ ho@@ ice &quot; and the David Mc@@ K@@ ay book , &quot; Su@@ sta@@ in@@ able En@@ erg@@ y Wi@@ th@@ out the H@@ ot A@@ ir . &quot;
They really go through it and create a fra@@ me@@ work that this can be disc@@ us@@ sed bro@@ ad@@ ly , because we need bro@@ ad bac@@ king for this .
There &apos;s a lot that has to come together .
So this is a wish .
It &apos;s a very con@@ cre@@ te wish that we inv@@ ent this technology .
If you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years -- I could pick who &apos;s pres@@ i@@ dent , I could pick a v@@ acc@@ ine , which is something I love , or I could pick that this thing that &apos;s half the cost with no CO2 gets inv@@ ented -- this is the wish I would pick .
This is the one with the great@@ est impact .
If we don &apos;t get this wish , the di@@ vision between the people who think short term and long term will be terri@@ ble , between the U.S. and China , between poor countries and rich , and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far wor@@ se .
So , what do we have to do ?
What am I appe@@ aling to you to step forward and drive ?
We need to go for more research fund@@ ing .
When countries get together in places like C@@ open@@ ha@@ gen , they sh@@ ouldn &apos;t just disc@@ uss the CO2 .
They should disc@@ uss this innovation a@@ gen@@ da , and you &apos;d be st@@ un@@ ned at the ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ously low le@@ vels of sp@@ ending on these innov@@ ative appro@@ ach@@ es .
We do need the market inc@@ enti@@ ves -- CO2 ta@@ x , ca@@ p and tra@@ de -- something that gets that price sig@@ nal out there .
We need to get the message out .
We need to have this di@@ al@@ og@@ ue be a more ra@@ tional , more under@@ stand@@ able di@@ al@@ og@@ ue , inclu@@ ding the st@@ ep@@ s that the government takes .
This is an important wish , but it is one I think we can ach@@ ie@@ ve .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you . So to understand more about Ter@@ ra@@ Po@@ wer , right -- I mean , first of all , can you give a sense of what scale of inv@@ est@@ ment this is ?
B@@ il G@@ ates : To actually do the software , buy the super@@ computer , hi@@ re all the great scientists , which we &apos;ve done , that &apos;s only tens of millions , and even once we test our materials out in a Rus@@ si@@ an re@@ ac@@ tor to make sure that our materials work proper@@ ly , then you &apos;ll only be up in the hundreds of millions .
The t@@ ough thing is building the p@@ il@@ ot re@@ ac@@ tor ; fin@@ ding the several billion , fin@@ ding the reg@@ ul@@ ator , the loc@@ ation that will actually build the first one of these .
On@@ ce you get the first one built , if it works as ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sed , then it &apos;s just clear as day , because the econom@@ ics , the energy den@@ s@@ ity , are so different than nuclear as we know it .
CA : And so , to understand it right , this invol@@ ves building deep into the ground almost like a ver@@ tical kind of col@@ um@@ n of nuclear fu@@ el , of this sort of spent ur@@ ani@@ um , and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down ?
B@@ G : That &apos;s right . To@@ day , you &apos;re always re@@ fu@@ el@@ ing the re@@ ac@@ tor , so you have lots of people and lots of contro@@ ls that can go wrong : that thing where you &apos;re op@@ ening it up and moving things in and out , that &apos;s not good .
So , if you have very che@@ ap fu@@ el that you can put 60 years in -- just think of it as a lo@@ g -- put it down and not have those same comple@@ xi@@ ties .
And it just s@@ its there and bur@@ ns for the 60 years , and then it &apos;s done .
CA : It &apos;s a nuclear power plant that is its own wa@@ ste dis@@ pos@@ al solution .
B@@ G : Yeah . Well , what happens with the wa@@ ste , you can let it sit there -- there &apos;s a lot less wa@@ ste under this approach -- then you can actually take that , and put it into another one and bur@@ n that .
And we start off actually by taking the wa@@ ste that ex@@ ists today , that &apos;s sitting in these co@@ ol@@ ing po@@ ols or dr@@ y c@@ asking by re@@ ac@@ tors -- that &apos;s our fu@@ el to begin with .
So , the thing that &apos;s been a problem from those re@@ ac@@ tors is actually what gets f@@ ed into ours , and you &apos;re re@@ duc@@ ing the vol@@ u@@ me of the wa@@ ste quite drama@@ tically as you &apos;re going through this process .
CA : I mean , you &apos;re talking to different people around the world about the possi@@ bili@@ ties here .
Where is there most interest in actually doing something with this ?
B@@ G : Well , we haven &apos;t pi@@ cked a particular place , and there &apos;s all these interesting dis@@ clos@@ ure rules about anything that &apos;s called &quot; nuclear , &quot; so we &apos;ve got a lot of interest , that people from the company have been in Rus@@ si@@ a , India , China -- I &apos;ve been back seeing the sec@@ ret@@ ary of energy here , talking about how this f@@ its into the energy a@@ gen@@ da .
So I &apos;m op@@ tim@@ is@@ tic . You know , the Fr@@ en@@ ch and Jap@@ an@@ ese have done some work .
This is a vari@@ ant on something that has been done .
It &apos;s an important ad@@ v@@ ance , but it &apos;s like a fast re@@ ac@@ tor , and a lot of countries have built them , so anybody who &apos;s done a fast re@@ ac@@ tor is a can@@ di@@ da@@ te to be where the first one gets built .
CA : So , in your mind , tim@@ es@@ c@@ ale and li@@ ke@@ li@@ hood of actually taking something like this live ?
B@@ G : Well , we need -- for one of these high-@@ scale , elec@@ tro@@ -@@ generation things that &apos;s very che@@ ap , we have 20 years to inv@@ ent and then 20 years to dep@@ lo@@ y .
That &apos;s sort of the de@@ ad@@ line that the environ@@ mental models have sho@@ wn us that we have to meet .
And , you know , Ter@@ ra@@ Po@@ wer , if things go well -- which is wis@@ h@@ ing for a lot -- could eas@@ ily meet that .
And there are , fortun@@ ately now , do@@ z@@ ens of companies -- we need it to be hundreds -- who , li@@ ke@@ wise , if their science goes well , if the fund@@ ing for their p@@ il@@ ot plants goes well , that they can compe@@ te for this .
And it &apos;s best if multi@@ ple suc@@ ce@@ ed , because then you could use a mi@@ x of these things .
We certainly need one to suc@@ ce@@ ed .
CA : In terms of big@@ -@@ scale possible game changes , is this the biggest that you &apos;re a@@ ware of out there ?
B@@ G : An energy bre@@ ak@@ through is the most important thing .
It would have been , even without the environ@@ mental con@@ stra@@ int , but the environ@@ mental con@@ stra@@ int just makes it so much gre@@ ater .
In the nuclear space , there are other innov@@ ators .
You know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as we know this one , but the mod@@ ular people , that &apos;s a different approach .
There &apos;s a li@@ qui@@ d-@@ type re@@ ac@@ tor , which seems a little hard , but maybe they say that about us .
And so , there are different ones , but the beau@@ ty of this is a molec@@ ule of ur@@ ani@@ um has a million times as much energy as a molec@@ ule of , say , co@@ al , and so -- if you can deal with the neg@@ ati@@ ves , which are essentially the radi@@ ation -- the fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int and cost , the potential , in terms of effect on land and vari@@ ous things , is almost in a class of its own .
CA : If this doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
Do we have to start taking em@@ er@@ gen@@ cy meas@@ ures to try and keep the temper@@ ature of the earth st@@ able ?
B@@ G : If you get into that situation , it &apos;s like if you &apos;ve been over@@ -@@ e@@ ating , and you &apos;re about to have a heart att@@ ack : Then where do you go ? You may need heart sur@@ ger@@ y or something .
There is a line of research on what &apos;s called ge@@ o@@ engine@@ ering , which are vari@@ ous techni@@ qu@@ es that would d@@ el@@ ay the he@@ ating to buy us 20 or 30 years to get our act together .
Now , that &apos;s just an in@@ sur@@ ance polic@@ y .
You hope you don &apos;t need to do that .
Some people say you sh@@ ouldn &apos;t even work on the in@@ sur@@ ance polic@@ y because it might make you la@@ zy , that you &apos;ll keep e@@ ating because you know heart sur@@ ger@@ y will be there to save you .
I &apos;m not sure that &apos;s wise , given the import@@ ance of the problem , but there &apos;s now the ge@@ o@@ engine@@ ering disc@@ us@@ sion about -- should that be in the back po@@ cket in case things happen fa@@ ster , or this innovation goes a lot s@@ lower than we expect ?
CA : C@@ li@@ mate sk@@ ep@@ tics : If you had a s@@ ent@@ ence or two to say to them , how might you per@@ su@@ ade them that they &apos;re wrong ?
B@@ G : Well , un@@ fortun@@ ately , the sk@@ ep@@ tics come in different cam@@ ps .
The ones who make scientific arg@@ um@@ ents are very few .
A@@ re they saying that there &apos;s neg@@ ative fe@@ ed@@ back eff@@ ects that have to do with cl@@ ou@@ ds that off@@ set things ?
There are very , very few things that they can even say there &apos;s a chance in a million of those things .
The main problem we have here , it &apos;s kind of like AIDS .
You make the mis@@ take now , and you pay for it a lot later .
And so , when you have all sorts of ur@@ gent problems , the idea of taking pa@@ in now that has to do with a gain later , and a some@@ what un@@ certain pa@@ in thing -- in fact , the I@@ P@@ C@@ C rep@@ ort , that &apos;s not necess@@ arily the wor@@ st case , and there are people in the rich world who look at I@@ P@@ C@@ C and say , &quot; OK , that isn &apos;t that big of a deal . &quot;
The fact is it &apos;s that un@@ certain part that should move us towards this .
But my dre@@ am here is that , if you can make it economic , and meet the CO2 con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts , then the sk@@ ep@@ tics say , &quot; OK , I don &apos;t care that it doesn &apos;t put out CO2 , I kind of wish it did put out CO2 , but I guess I &apos;ll ac@@ cept it because it &apos;s che@@ aper than what &apos;s come before . &quot;
CA : And so , that would be your response to the B@@ j@@ or@@ n L@@ om@@ bor@@ g arg@@ ument , that basically if you spend all this energy trying to solve the CO2 problem , it &apos;s going to take away all your other go@@ als of trying to ri@@ d the world of poverty and mal@@ aria and so for@@ th , it &apos;s a stu@@ p@@ id wa@@ ste of the Earth &apos;s resources to put money towards that when there are better things we can do .
B@@ G : Well , the ac@@ tual sp@@ ending on the R &@@ amp@@ ; am@@ p ; D piece -- say the U.S. should spend 10 billion a year more than it is right now -- it &apos;s not that drama@@ tic .
It sh@@ ouldn &apos;t take away from other things .
The thing you get into big money on , and this , reas@@ on@@ able people can dis@@ ag@@ ree , is when you have something that &apos;s non-@@ economic and you &apos;re trying to f@@ und that -- that , to me , mos@@ tly is a wa@@ ste .
Un@@ less you &apos;re very close and you &apos;re just fund@@ ing the learning cur@@ ve and it &apos;s going to get very che@@ ap , I believe we should try more things that have a potential to be far less exp@@ ensive .
If the tra@@ de@@ -@@ off you get into is , &quot; Let &apos;s make energy su@@ per exp@@ ensive , &quot; then the rich can aff@@ ord that .
I mean , all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our li@@ fest@@ y@@ le .
The dis@@ a@@ ster is for that two billion .
And even L@@ om@@ bor@@ g has changed .
H@@ is sh@@ ti@@ ck now is , &quot; Why isn &apos;t the R &@@ amp@@ ; am@@ p ; D getting more disc@@ us@@ sed ? &quot;
He &apos;s still , because of his ear@@ li@@ er stuff , still as@@ soci@@ ated with the sk@@ ep@@ tic cam@@ p , but he &apos;s realized that &apos;s a pretty lon@@ ely cam@@ p , and so , he &apos;s making the R &@@ amp@@ ; am@@ p ; D point .
And so there is a th@@ read of something that I think is appro@@ pri@@ ate .
The R &@@ amp@@ ; am@@ p ; D piece , it &apos;s cra@@ zy how little it &apos;s fund@@ ed .
CA : Well Bill , I sus@@ pect I speak on the beh@@ al@@ f of most people here to say I really hope your wish comes true . Thank you so much .
B@@ G : Thank you .
I &apos;d like to share with you a disco@@ very that I made a few months ago while writing an artic@@ le for I@@ tal@@ ian Wi@@ red .
I always keep my thes@@ aur@@ us hand@@ y wh@@ en@@ ever I &apos;m writing anything , but I &apos;d already fin@@ ished edi@@ ting the piece , and I realized that I had never once in my life looked up the word &quot; dis@@ ab@@ led &quot; to see what I &apos;d find .
Let me read you the ent@@ ry .
&quot; Dis@@ ab@@ led , ad@@ jec@@ tive : cri@@ p@@ pl@@ ed , hel@@ pl@@ ess , us@@ eless , w@@ re@@ cked , st@@ all@@ ed , ma@@ im@@ ed , wo@@ und@@ ed , man@@ gl@@ ed , l@@ ame , mu@@ ti@@ l@@ ated , run@@ -@@ down , wor@@ n@@ -@@ out , we@@ ak@@ en@@ ed , imp@@ ot@@ ent , ca@@ str@@ ated , par@@ aly@@ zed , han@@ dic@@ app@@ ed , sen@@ i@@ le , de@@ cre@@ p@@ it , la@@ i@@ d-@@ up , don@@ e-@@ up , don@@ e-@@ for , don@@ e-@@ in cra@@ ck@@ e@@ d-@@ up , coun@@ te@@ d-@@ out ; see also h@@ urt , us@@ eless and we@@ ak .
Ant@@ on@@ y@@ ms , heal@@ thy , strong , cap@@ able . &quot;
I was read@@ ing this list out l@@ oud to a friend and at first was lau@@ gh@@ ing , it was so lu@@ dic@@ r@@ ous , but I &apos;d just got@@ ten past &quot; man@@ gl@@ ed , &quot; and my vo@@ ice bro@@ ke , and I had to stop and collec@@ t myself from the emo@@ tional sho@@ ck and impact that the ass@@ au@@ lt from these words un@@ le@@ ash@@ ed .
You know , of course , this is my ra@@ g@@ ge@@ dy old thes@@ aur@@ us so I &apos;m thinking this must be an an@@ ci@@ ent pr@@ int da@@ te , right ?
But , in fact , the pr@@ int da@@ te was the early 198@@ 0s , when I would have been starting pri@@ mar@@ y school and form@@ ing an understanding of myself outside the family un@@ it and as rel@@ ated to the other kids and the world around me .
And , nee@@ d@@ less to say , thank God I wasn &apos;t using a thes@@ aur@@ us back then .
I mean , from this ent@@ ry , it would seem that I was born into a world that perc@@ ei@@ ved someone like me to have nothing positive what@@ so@@ ever going for them , when in fact , today I &apos;m c@@ ele@@ br@@ ated for the opport@@ unities and ad@@ vent@@ ures my life has pro@@ cu@@ red .
So , I immedi@@ ately went to look up the 200@@ 9 online edi@@ tion , exp@@ ec@@ ting to find a re@@ vision worth not@@ ing .
Here &apos;s the up@@ d@@ ated version of this ent@@ ry .
Un@@ fortun@@ ately , it &apos;s not much better .
I find the last two words under &quot; Ne@@ ar Ant@@ on@@ y@@ ms , &quot; particularly uns@@ ett@@ ling : &quot; whole &quot; and &quot; wh@@ ol@@ es@@ ome . &quot;
So , it &apos;s not just about the words .
It &apos;s what we believe about people when we name them with these words .
It &apos;s about the val@@ ues behind the words , and how we construc@@ t those val@@ ues .
Our language aff@@ ects our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people .
In fact , many an@@ ci@@ ent soci@@ e@@ ties , inclu@@ ding the Gre@@ e@@ ks and the R@@ om@@ ans , be@@ liev@@ ed that to utter a cur@@ se verb@@ ally was so powerful , because to say the thing out l@@ oud brought it into ex@@ ist@@ ence .
So , what reality do we want to call into ex@@ ist@@ ence : a person who is limit@@ ed , or a person who &apos;s em@@ power@@ ed ?
By c@@ as@@ ually doing something as simple as nam@@ ing a person , a child , we might be putting li@@ ds and c@@ ast@@ ing sha@@ do@@ ws on their power .
W@@ ouldn &apos;t we want to open do@@ ors for them instead ?
One such person who open@@ ed do@@ ors for me was my chil@@ d@@ hood doc@@ tor at the A@@ .@@ I@@ . du@@ P@@ on@@ t Institu@@ te in Wil@@ m@@ ington , Del@@ a@@ ware .
H@@ is name was Dr. Pi@@ z@@ zu@@ ti@@ ll@@ o , an I@@ tal@@ ian American , wh@@ ose name , ap@@ par@@ ently , was too difficult for most Americ@@ ans to pr@@ on@@ oun@@ ce , so he went by Dr. P .
And Dr. P always wor@@ e really col@@ or@@ ful b@@ ow ties and had the very perfect dis@@ position to work with children .
I lo@@ ved almost everything about my time spent at this hosp@@ ital , with the exc@@ ep@@ tion of my physical ther@@ ap@@ y s@@ es@@ sions .
I had to do what seem@@ ed like inn@@ um@@ er@@ able re@@ pe@@ ti@@ tions of ex@@ er@@ cis@@ es with these th@@ ick , el@@ as@@ tic b@@ ands -- different col@@ ors , you know -- to help build up my le@@ g mus@@ cles , and I hat@@ ed these b@@ ands more than anything -- I hat@@ ed them , had nam@@ es for them . I hat@@ ed them .
And , you know , I was already bar@@ ga@@ ining , as a five year-old child , with Dr. P to try to get out of doing these ex@@ er@@ cis@@ es , un@@ success@@ fully , of course .
And , one day , he came in to my s@@ es@@ sion -- ex@@ h@@ aus@@ tive and un@@ for@@ giving , these s@@ es@@ sions -- and he said to me , &quot; W@@ ow . A@@ im@@ ee , you are such a strong and powerful little girl , I think you &apos;re going to break one of those b@@ ands .
When you do break it , I &apos;m going to give you a hundred bu@@ cks . &quot;
Now , of course , this was a simple p@@ lo@@ y on Dr. P &apos;s part to get me to do the ex@@ er@@ cis@@ es I didn &apos;t want to do before the pr@@ osp@@ ect of being the ri@@ ch@@ est fi@@ v@@ e-@@ year-old in the second flo@@ or ward , but what he effec@@ tively did for me was res@@ h@@ ape an aw@@ ful da@@ ily oc@@ curr@@ ence into a new and promis@@ ing experience for me .
And I have to w@@ on@@ der today to what ex@@ t@@ ent his vision and his de@@ cl@@ ar@@ ation of me as a strong and powerful little girl shap@@ ed my own view of myself as an in@@ her@@ ently strong , powerful and a@@ th@@ le@@ tic person well into the future .
This is an example of how ad@@ ults in posi@@ tions of power can ig@@ ni@@ te the power of a child .
But , in the pre@@ vi@@ ous inst@@ an@@ ces of those thes@@ aur@@ us ent@@ ries , our language isn &apos;t allo@@ wing us to evol@@ ve into the reality that we would all want , the possi@@ bility of an individual to see themselves as cap@@ able .
Our language h@@ asn &apos;t c@@ au@@ ght up with the changes in our society , many of which have been brought about by technology .
C@@ er@@ tain@@ ly , from a medi@@ cal stand@@ point , my legs , l@@ as@@ er sur@@ ger@@ y for vision im@@ pa@@ ir@@ ment , tit@@ ani@@ um k@@ ne@@ es and hi@@ p re@@ plac@@ ements for aging bo@@ dies that are allo@@ wing people to more fully eng@@ age with their abili@@ ties , and move beyond the limit@@ s that nature has im@@ pos@@ ed on them -- not to men@@ tion social net@@ working plat@@ forms allow people to self-@@ identi@@ fy , to c@@ la@@ im their own descri@@ p@@ tions of themselves ,
so they can go al@@ ig@@ n with global groups of their own cho@@ os@@ ing .
So , perhaps technology is re@@ ve@@ aling more clear@@ ly to us now what has always been a truth : that everyone has something r@@ are and powerful to off@@ er our society , and that the human ability to ad@@ ap@@ t is our great@@ est as@@ set .
The human ability to ad@@ ap@@ t , it &apos;s an interesting thing , because people have contin@@ ually wanted to talk to me about over@@ coming ad@@ versity , and I &apos;m going to make an ad@@ mission : This p@@ hr@@ ase never s@@ at right with me , and I always felt un@@ easy trying to answer people &apos;s questions about it , and I think I &apos;m starting to figure out why .
I@@ mp@@ lic@@ it in this p@@ hr@@ ase of &quot; over@@ coming ad@@ versity &quot; is the idea that success , or happiness , is about em@@ erg@@ ing on the other side of a challen@@ ging experience uns@@ ca@@ th@@ ed or un@@ mar@@ ked by the experience , as if my success@@ es in life have come about from an ability to si@@ des@@ te@@ p or cir@@ c@@ um@@ n@@ avi@@ g@@ ate the pres@@ um@@ ed p@@ it@@ falls of a life with pr@@ os@@ the@@ tics , or what other people perc@@ ei@@ ve as my dis@@ ability .
But , in fact , we are changed . We are mar@@ ked , of course , by a challenge , whether physi@@ cally , emo@@ tion@@ ally or both .
And I &apos;m going to sug@@ gest that this is a good thing .
Ad@@ versity isn &apos;t an ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le that we need to get around in order to res@@ u@@ me living our life .
It &apos;s part of our life .
And I tend to think of it like my sha@@ d@@ ow .
Some@@ times I see a lot of it , sometimes there &apos;s very little , but it &apos;s always with me .
And , certainly , I &apos;m not trying to di@@ min@@ ish the impact , the wei@@ ght , of a person &apos;s stru@@ g@@ g@@ le .
There is ad@@ versity and challenge in life , and it &apos;s all very real and rel@@ ative to every single person , but the question isn &apos;t whether or not you &apos;re going to meet ad@@ versity , but how you &apos;re going to meet it .
So , our responsi@@ bility is not simply shi@@ el@@ ding those we care for from ad@@ versity , but pre@@ par@@ ing them to meet it well .
And we do a dis@@ service to our kids when we make them feel that they &apos;re not equi@@ pped to ad@@ ap@@ t .
There &apos;s an important difference and dis@@ tin@@ ction between the ob@@ jec@@ tive medi@@ cal fact of my being an am@@ pu@@ te@@ e and the sub@@ jec@@ tive soci@@ et@@ al op@@ ini@@ on of whether or not I &apos;m dis@@ ab@@ led .
And , tru@@ th@@ fully , the only real and con@@ s@@ ist@@ ent dis@@ ability I &apos;ve had to con@@ front is the world ever thinking that I could be descri@@ bed by those defin@@ i@@ tions .
In our des@@ ire to prot@@ ect those we care about by giving them the c@@ old , hard truth about their medi@@ cal pro@@ gn@@ os@@ is , or , in@@ deed , a pro@@ gn@@ os@@ is on the exp@@ ected quality of their life , we have to make sure that we don &apos;t put the first bri@@ ck in a wall that will actually dis@@ able someone .
Per@@ haps the exis@@ ting model of only looking at what is bro@@ ken in you and how do we fi@@ x it , ser@@ ves to be more dis@@ ab@@ ling to the individual than the pa@@ th@@ ology itself .
By not tre@@ ating the wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess of a person , by not ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ging their pot@@ ency , we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural stru@@ g@@ g@@ le they might have .
We are effec@@ tively gra@@ ding someone &apos;s worth to our community .
So we need to see through the pa@@ th@@ ology and into the range of human cap@@ ability .
And , most import@@ antly , there &apos;s a part@@ ner@@ ship between those perc@@ ei@@ ved def@@ ici@@ en@@ ci@@ es and our great@@ est creative ability .
So it &apos;s not about de@@ val@@ u@@ ing , or neg@@ ating , these more trying times as something we want to av@@ o@@ id or swe@@ ep under the ru@@ g , but instead to find those opport@@ unities wr@@ app@@ ed in the ad@@ versity .
So maybe the idea I want to put out there is not so much over@@ coming ad@@ versity as it is op@@ ening ourselves up to it , em@@ bra@@ cing it , grap@@ pl@@ ing with it , to use a w@@ res@@ t@@ ling term , maybe even dan@@ cing with it .
And , perhaps , if we see ad@@ versity as natural , con@@ s@@ ist@@ ent and us@@ eful , we &apos;re less bur@@ den@@ ed by the pres@@ ence of it .
This year we c@@ ele@@ bra@@ te the 200@@ th bir@@ th@@ day of Charles Dar@@ win , and it was 150 years ago , when writing about evolution , that Dar@@ win il@@ lu@@ str@@ ated , I think , a truth about the human charac@@ ter .
To par@@ ap@@ hr@@ ase : It &apos;s not the stron@@ gest of the species that survi@@ ves , n@@ or is it the most intelli@@ gent that survi@@ ves ; it is the one that is most ad@@ ap@@ table to change .
Con@@ f@@ lic@@ t is the gen@@ es@@ is of cre@@ ation .
F@@ rom Dar@@ win &apos;s work , am@@ on@@ gst others , we can recogni@@ ze that the human ability to survi@@ ve and fl@@ our@@ ish is dri@@ ven by the stru@@ g@@ g@@ le of the human spir@@ it through conf@@ lic@@ t into trans@@ formation .
So , again , trans@@ formation , ad@@ ap@@ tation , is our great@@ est human sk@@ ill .
And , perhaps , until we &apos;re tes@@ ted , we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re made of .
Maybe that &apos;s what ad@@ versity gives us : a sense of self , a sense of our own power .
So , we can give ourselves a gi@@ ft .
We can re-@@ imagine ad@@ versity as something more than just t@@ ough times .
Maybe we can see it as change .
Ad@@ versity is just change that we haven &apos;t ad@@ ap@@ ted ourselves to yet .
I think the great@@ est ad@@ versity that we &apos;ve created for ourselves is this idea of normal@@ cy .
Now , who &apos;s normal ?
There &apos;s no normal .
There &apos;s common , there &apos;s ty@@ pic@@ al . There &apos;s no normal , and would you want to meet that poor , bei@@ ge person if they exis@@ ted ?
I don &apos;t think so .
If we can change this par@@ a@@ dig@@ m from one of ach@@ i@@ ev@@ ing normal@@ cy to one of possi@@ bility -- or pot@@ ency , to be even a little bit more danger@@ ous -- we can rel@@ ease the power of so many more children , and in@@ vi@@ te them to eng@@ age their r@@ are and val@@ u@@ able abili@@ ties with the community .
An@@ th@@ rop@@ olog@@ ists tell us that the one thing we as humans have always re@@ qui@@ red of our community mem@@ bers is to be of use , to be able to con@@ tribu@@ te .
There &apos;s evidence that Ne@@ ander@@ th@@ als , 6@@ 0,000 years ago , car@@ ried their el@@ der@@ ly and those with serious physical in@@ j@@ ury , and perhaps it &apos;s because the life experience of survi@@ v@@ al of these people pro@@ ved of value to the community .
They didn &apos;t view these people as bro@@ ken and us@@ eless ; they were seen as r@@ are and val@@ u@@ able .
A few years ago , I was in a food market in the town where I gre@@ w up in that red z@@ one in nor@@ the@@ ast@@ ern P@@ enn@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ani@@ a , and I was standing over a bus@@ h@@ el of tom@@ at@@ o@@ es .
It was su@@ mm@@ er@@ time : I had sh@@ or@@ ts on .
I hear this guy , his vo@@ ice behind me say , &quot; Well , if it isn &apos;t A@@ im@@ ee M@@ ul@@ lin@@ s . &quot;
And I turn around , and it &apos;s this ol@@ der man . I have no idea who he is .
And I said , &quot; I &apos;m sor@@ ry , si@@ r , have we met ? I don &apos;t remember me@@ eting you . &quot;
He said , &quot; Well , you wouldn &apos;t remember me@@ eting me .
I mean , when we met I was deli@@ ver@@ ing you from your mother &apos;s wom@@ b . &quot;
Oh , that guy .
And , but of course , actually , it did cli@@ ck .
This man was Dr. K@@ e@@ an , a man that I had only known about through my mother &apos;s stories of that day , because , of course , ty@@ pic@@ al fas@@ hi@@ on , I ar@@ ri@@ ved late for my bir@@ th@@ day by two weeks .
And so my mother &apos;s pr@@ en@@ at@@ al physi@@ ci@@ an had gone on v@@ ac@@ ation , so the man who deli@@ vered me was a comple@@ te st@@ ran@@ ger to my parents .
And , because I was born without the fi@@ bul@@ a b@@ ones , and had feet turned in , and a few to@@ es in this foot and a few to@@ es in that , he had to be the be@@ ar@@ er -- this st@@ ran@@ ger had to be the be@@ ar@@ er of bad news .
He said to me , &quot; I had to give this pro@@ gn@@ os@@ is to your parents that you would never walk , and you would never have the kind of mo@@ bility that other kids have or any kind of life of in@@ dep@@ en@@ dence , and you &apos;ve been making li@@ ar out of me ever since . &quot;
The extraordinary thing is that he said he had sa@@ ved new@@ sp@@ aper cli@@ pp@@ ings thr@@ ough@@ out my whole chil@@ d@@ hood , whether w@@ inning a second gra@@ de sp@@ ell@@ ing be@@ e , mar@@ ching with the G@@ ir@@ l S@@ cou@@ ts , you know , the H@@ allo@@ ween par@@ ade , w@@ inning my col@@ lege sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ ship , or any of my sp@@ or@@ ts vi@@ c@@ tor@@ ies , and he was using it , and inte@@ gr@@ ating it into teach@@ ing res@@ i@@ dent students , m@@ ed students from H@@ ah@@ ne@@ m@@ ann Medi@@ cal Sch@@ ool and Her@@ sh@@ ey Medi@@ cal Sch@@ ool .
And he called this part of the course the X F@@ ac@@ tor , the potential of the human will .
No pro@@ gn@@ os@@ is can accoun@@ t for how powerful this could be as a de@@ ter@@ min@@ ant in the quality of someone &apos;s life .
And Dr. K@@ e@@ an went on to tell me , he said , &quot; In my experience , un@@ less re@@ pe@@ at@@ e@@ dly told o@@ ther@@ wise , and even if given a mo@@ dic@@ um of support , if left to their own de@@ vices , a child will ach@@ ie@@ ve . &quot;
Se@@ e , Dr. K@@ e@@ an made that shi@@ ft in thinking .
He under@@ stood that there &apos;s a difference between the medi@@ cal condi@@ tion and what someone might do with it .
And there &apos;s been a shi@@ ft in my thinking over time , in that , if you had asked me at 15 years old , if I would have tra@@ ded pr@@ os@@ the@@ tics for fl@@ es@@ h@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ b@@ one legs , I wouldn &apos;t have h@@ es@@ it@@ ated for a second .
I as@@ pi@@ red to that kind of normal@@ cy back then .
But if you ask me today , I &apos;m not so sure .
And it &apos;s because of the experi@@ ences I &apos;ve had with them , not in spi@@ te of the experi@@ ences I &apos;ve had with them .
And perhaps this shi@@ ft in me has happened because I &apos;ve been ex@@ pos@@ ed to more people who have open@@ ed do@@ ors for me than those who have put li@@ ds and c@@ ast sha@@ do@@ ws on me .
Se@@ e , all you really need is one person to show you the epi@@ ph@@ any of your own power , and you &apos;re off .
If you can hand somebody the key to their own power -- the human spir@@ it is so rec@@ ep@@ tive -- if you can do that and open a door for someone at a c@@ ru@@ cial moment , you are educ@@ ating them in the best sense .
You &apos;re teach@@ ing them to open do@@ ors for themselves .
In fact , the ex@@ act meaning of the word &quot; educ@@ ate &quot; comes from the ro@@ ot word &quot; e@@ du@@ ce . &quot;
It means &quot; to bring for@@ th what is within , to bring out potential . &quot;
So again , which potential do we want to bring out ?
There was a case study done in 196@@ 0s Bri@@ tain , when they were moving from gra@@ m@@ ma@@ r schools to comp@@ re@@ h@@ ensive schools .
It &apos;s called the stre@@ am@@ ing tri@@ als . We call it &quot; tra@@ cking &quot; here in the States .
It &apos;s separ@@ ating students from A , B , C , D and so on .
And the &quot; A students &quot; get the t@@ ough@@ er cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um , the best teachers , etc .
Well , they took , over a thre@@ e-@@ month period , D@@ -@@ level students , gave them A &apos;s , told them they were &quot; A &apos;s , &quot; told them they were b@@ right , and at the end of this thre@@ e-@@ month period , they were per@@ form@@ ing at A-@@ level .
And , of course , the hear@@ t@@ brea@@ king , fli@@ p side of this study , is that they took the &quot; A students &quot; and told them they were &quot; D &apos;s . &quot;
And that &apos;s what happened at the end of that thre@@ e-@@ month period .
Those who were still around in school , bes@@ i@@ des the people who had dro@@ pped out .
A c@@ ru@@ cial part of this case study was that the teachers were du@@ p@@ ed too .
The teachers didn &apos;t know a s@@ wit@@ ch had been made .
They were simply told , &quot; These are the &apos; A-@@ students , &apos; these are the &apos; D@@ -@@ students . &apos; &quot; And that &apos;s how they went about teach@@ ing them and tre@@ ating them .
So , I think that the only true dis@@ ability is a cr@@ ush@@ ed spir@@ it , a spir@@ it that &apos;s been cr@@ ush@@ ed doesn &apos;t have hope , it doesn &apos;t see beau@@ ty , it no longer has our natural , chil@@ d@@ like cu@@ ri@@ os@@ ity and our inn@@ ate ability to imagine .
If instead , we can b@@ ol@@ ster a human spir@@ it to keep hope , to see beau@@ ty in themselves and others , to be cu@@ ri@@ ous and imag@@ in@@ ative , then we are tru@@ ly using our power well .
When a spir@@ it has those qu@@ ali@@ ties , we are able to create new reali@@ ties and new ways of being .
I &apos;d like to leave you with a po@@ em by a f@@ our@@ te@@ enth@@ -@@ century Per@@ si@@ an po@@ et named Ha@@ fi@@ z that my friend , J@@ ac@@ qu@@ es Dem@@ bo@@ is told me about , and the po@@ em is called &quot; The God Who On@@ ly Kno@@ ws F@@ our Wor@@ ds &quot; : &quot; Every child has known God , not the God of nam@@ es , not the God of don &apos;@@ ts , but the God who only knows four words and ke@@ ep@@ s re@@ pe@@ ating them , saying , &apos; C@@ ome dan@@ ce with me .
C@@ ome , dan@@ ce with me . C@@ ome , dan@@ ce with me . &apos; &quot; Thank you .
