Se@@ ver@@ al years ago here at TED , P@@ eter S@@ k@@ ill@@ man in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed a design ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge called the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ low ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge .
And the idea &apos;s pretty sim@@ ple : Te@@ am@@ s of four have to bu@@ ild the t@@ all@@ est fre@@ e-@@ stand@@ ing struc@@ ture out of 20 sti@@ cks of sp@@ a@@ gh@@ et@@ t@@ i , one y@@ ard of t@@ ap@@ e , one y@@ ard of str@@ ing and a mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ low .
The mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ low has to be on top .
And , th@@ ough it se@@ em@@ s really sim@@ ple , it &apos;s actually pretty har@@ d because it for@@ ces people to c@@ oll@@ ab@@ or@@ ate very qui@@ ck@@ ly .
And so , I thought this was an interesting idea , and I in@@ cor@@ por@@ ated it into a design wor@@ k@@ sho@@ p .
And it was a hu@@ ge su@@ c@@ cess .
And sin@@ ce then , I &apos;ve con@@ duc@@ ted about 7@@ 0 design wor@@ k@@ sh@@ op@@ s ac@@ ross the world with stu@@ d@@ ents and desig@@ n@@ ers and ar@@ chit@@ ects , even the C@@ T@@ O@@ s of the For@@ t@@ un@@ e 50 , and there &apos;s something about this ex@@ er@@ c@@ is@@ e that re@@ v@@ e@@ als very de@@ ep l@@ ess@@ ons about the nat@@ ure of c@@ oll@@ ab@@ or@@ ation , and I &apos;d like to sh@@ are some of them with you .
So , nor@@ m@@ ally , most people beg@@ in by ori@@ ent@@ ing the@@ m@@ selves to the t@@ ask .
They talk about it , they fig@@ ure out what it &apos;s going to look like , they j@@ o@@ ck@@ ey for power .
Th@@ en they sp@@ end some time plan@@ ning , organ@@ i@@ zing , they sk@@ et@@ ch and they l@@ ay out sp@@ a@@ gh@@ et@@ t@@ i .
They sp@@ end the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of their time ass@@ em@@ bl@@ ing the sti@@ cks into e@@ ver@@ -@@ gro@@ wing struc@@ tur@@ es .
And then fin@@ ally , just as they &apos;re r@@ un@@ ning out of time , some@@ one ta@@ kes out the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ low , and then they g@@ ing@@ er@@ ly put it on top , and then they stand back , and -- ta@@ -@@ da ! -- they ad@@ m@@ ir@@ e their work .
But what really happ@@ ens , most of the time , is that the &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; tur@@ ns into an &quot; u@@ h@@ -@@ o@@ h , &quot; because the wei@@ ght of the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ low c@@ aus@@ es the enti@@ re struc@@ ture to bu@@ ck@@ le and to c@@ oll@@ ap@@ se .
So there are a number of people who have a lot more &quot; u@@ h@@ -@@ o@@ h &quot; m@@ om@@ ents than o@@ th@@ ers , and am@@ ong the wor@@ st are rec@@ ent gra@@ du@@ ates of bus@@ iness school .
They l@@ ie , they ch@@ e@@ at , they get dis@@ tra@@ c@@ ted and they produ@@ ce really l@@ ame struc@@ tur@@ es .
And of course there are te@@ am@@ s that have a lot more &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; struc@@ tur@@ es , and am@@ ong the best are rec@@ ent gra@@ du@@ ates of kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten .
And it &apos;s pretty a@@ ma@@ zing .
A@@ s P@@ eter tell@@ s us , not only do they produ@@ ce the t@@ all@@ est struc@@ tur@@ es , but they &apos;re the most interesting struc@@ tur@@ es of them all .
So the question you want to ask is : How come ? Wh@@ y ? What is it about them ?
And P@@ eter li@@ kes to say that n@@ one of the kids sp@@ end any time trying to be C@@ E@@ O of S@@ pa@@ gh@@ et@@ t@@ i , In@@ c . Ri@@ ght ?
They don &apos;t sp@@ end time j@@ o@@ ck@@ e@@ ying for power .
But there &apos;s another reas@@ on as well .
And the reas@@ on is that bus@@ iness stu@@ d@@ ents are tra@@ in@@ ed to find the s@@ ing@@ le right pl@@ an , right ?
And then they ex@@ ec@@ ute on it .
And then what happ@@ ens is , when they put the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ low on the top , they ru@@ n out of time and what happ@@ ens ?
It &apos;s a c@@ ris@@ is .
So@@ und fam@@ ili@@ ar ? Ri@@ ght .
What kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten@@ ers do differ@@ ent@@ ly is that they start with the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ low , and they bu@@ ild pr@@ ot@@ ot@@ yp@@ es , su@@ c@@ c@@ es@@ si@@ ve pr@@ ot@@ ot@@ yp@@ es , always ke@@ ep@@ ing the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ low on top , so they have m@@ ul@@ ti@@ ple times to fi@@ x when they bu@@ ild pr@@ ot@@ ot@@ yp@@ es al@@ ong the way .
Desig@@ n@@ ers rec@@ og@@ ni@@ ze this t@@ yp@@ e of c@@ oll@@ ab@@ or@@ ation as the ess@@ ence of the it@@ er@@ ative pro@@ cess .
And with each ver@@ sion , kids get in@@ st@@ ant fe@@ e@@ d@@ back about what wor@@ ks and what doesn &apos;t work .
So the cap@@ ac@@ ity to play in pr@@ ot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e is really ess@@ enti@@ al , but let &apos;s look at how different te@@ am@@ s per@@ form .
So the a@@ ver@@ age for most people is around 20 in@@ ches ; bus@@ iness sch@@ o@@ ol@@ s stu@@ d@@ ents , about hal@@ f of that ; la@@ w@@ y@@ ers , a little better , but not much better than that , kin@@ der@@ g@@ ar@@ ten@@ ers , better than most ad@@ ul@@ ts .
Wh@@ o does the very best ?
Ar@@ chit@@ ects and eng@@ in@@ e@@ ers , th@@ an@@ k@@ f@@ ul@@ ly .
Th@@ ir@@ t@@ y@@ -@@ n@@ ine in@@ ches is the t@@ all@@ est struc@@ ture I &apos;ve se@@ en .
And why is it ? Because they understand tri@@ an@@ gl@@ es and sel@@ f@@ -@@ r@@ ein@@ for@@ c@@ ing ge@@ om@@ et@@ ri@@ cal pat@@ ter@@ ns are the k@@ ey to building st@@ able struc@@ tur@@ es .
So C@@ E@@ O@@ s , a little bit better than a@@ ver@@ age , but here &apos;s where it ge@@ ts interesting .
If you put you put an ex@@ ec@@ u@@ tive ad@@ min@@ . on the te@@ am , they get sig@@ ni@@ f@@ ic@@ ant@@ ly better .
It &apos;s incre@@ di@@ ble . You know , you look around , you go , &quot; Oh , that te@@ am &apos;s going to w@@ in . &quot;
You can just tell be@@ for@@ eh@@ and . And why is that ?
Because they have spec@@ i@@ al sk@@ ill@@ s of fac@@ ili@@ ta@@ tion .
They man@@ age the pro@@ cess , they understand the pro@@ cess .
And any te@@ am who man@@ ag@@ es and pa@@ ys cl@@ ose at@@ ten@@ tion to work will sig@@ ni@@ f@@ ic@@ ant@@ ly im@@ pro@@ ve the te@@ am &apos;s per@@ for@@ man@@ ce .
Sp@@ ec@@ i@@ ali@@ zed sk@@ ill@@ s and fac@@ ili@@ ta@@ tion sk@@ ill@@ s are the com@@ bin@@ ation that lea@@ ds to str@@ ong su@@ c@@ cess .
If you have 10 te@@ am@@ s that t@@ y@@ pic@@ ally per@@ form , you &apos;ll get maybe si@@ x or so that have stand@@ ing struc@@ tur@@ es .
And I tri@@ ed something interesting .
I thought , let &apos;s up the an@@ te , on@@ ce .
So I off@@ er@@ ed a 10@@ ,000 d@@ ollar pri@@ ze of so@@ ft@@ w@@ are to the w@@ inn@@ ing te@@ am .
So what do you think happened to these design stu@@ d@@ ents ?
What was the res@@ ul@@ t ?
Here &apos;s what happened : N@@ ot one te@@ am had a stand@@ ing struc@@ ture .
If any@@ one had buil@@ t , say , a one in@@ ch struc@@ ture , they would have ta@@ ken h@@ ome the pri@@ ze .
So , is@@ n &apos;t that interesting ? That hi@@ gh st@@ ak@@ es have a str@@ ong imp@@ act .
We did the ex@@ er@@ c@@ is@@ e again with the same stu@@ d@@ ents .
What do you think happened then ?
So now they understand the val@@ ue of pr@@ ot@@ ot@@ yp@@ ing .
So the same te@@ am went from being the very wor@@ st to being am@@ ong the very best .
They produc@@ ed the t@@ all@@ est struc@@ tur@@ es in the le@@ ast am@@ o@@ un@@ t of time .
So there &apos;s de@@ ep l@@ ess@@ ons for us about the nat@@ ure of inc@@ enti@@ ves and su@@ c@@ cess .
So , you might ask : Wh@@ y would any@@ one actually sp@@ end time w@@ ri@@ ting a mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ low ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge ?
And the reas@@ on is , I help create dig@@ ital to@@ ol@@ s and pro@@ c@@ ess@@ es to help te@@ am@@ s bu@@ ild c@@ ars and vi@@ de@@ o g@@ am@@ es and vis@@ u@@ al eff@@ ects .
And what the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ low ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge does is it hel@@ ps them i@@ den@@ ti@@ f@@ y the hi@@ d@@ den as@@ su@@ mp@@ tions .
Because , f@@ rank@@ ly , every pro@@ ject has its own mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ low , doesn &apos;t it ?
The ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge pro@@ vi@@ des a sh@@ ar@@ ed experi@@ ence , a comm@@ on lan@@ gu@@ age , a comm@@ on st@@ ance to bu@@ ild the right pr@@ ot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e .
And so , this is the val@@ ue of the experi@@ ence , of this so sim@@ ple ex@@ er@@ c@@ is@@ e .
And those of you who are interes@@ ted may want to go to Mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ lo@@ w@@ Ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge@@ .@@ co@@ m .
It &apos;s a blo@@ g that you can look at how to bu@@ ild the mar@@ sh@@ m@@ al@@ lo@@ ws .
There &apos;s st@@ ep@@ -@@ b@@ y@@ -@@ ste@@ p in@@ struc@@ tions on this .
There are cra@@ z@@ y exam@@ pl@@ es from around the world of how people t@@ we@@ ak and ad@@ just the system .
There &apos;s world rec@@ or@@ ds that are on this as well .
And the f@@ und@@ am@@ ent@@ al l@@ ess@@ on , I believe , is that design tru@@ ly is a con@@ t@@ act sp@@ ort .
It de@@ m@@ and@@ s that we br@@ ing all of our sen@@ s@@ es to the t@@ ask , and that we app@@ ly the very best of our thinking , our fe@@ el@@ ing and our doing to the ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge that we have at h@@ and .
And some@@ times , a little pr@@ ot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e of this experi@@ ence is all that it ta@@ kes to tur@@ n us from an &quot; u@@ h@@ -@@ o@@ h &quot; m@@ oment to a &quot; ta@@ -@@ da &quot; m@@ oment .
And that can make a big differ@@ ence .
Thank you very much .
L@@ et &apos;s pre@@ t@@ end right here we have a ma@@ ch@@ ine .
A big ma@@ ch@@ ine , a co@@ ol , TE@@ D@@ -@@ ish ma@@ ch@@ ine , and it &apos;s a time ma@@ ch@@ ine .
And every@@ one in this ro@@ om has to get into it .
And you can go b@@ ack@@ war@@ ds , you can go for@@ war@@ ds ; you can@@ not st@@ ay where you are .
And I w@@ on@@ der what you &apos;d cho@@ ose , because I &apos;ve been as@@ king my fri@@ ends this question a lot l@@ at@@ ely and they all want to go back .
I don &apos;t know . They want to go back before there were au@@ t@@ om@@ ob@@ il@@ es or T@@ wi@@ t@@ ter or &quot; Ameri@@ can I@@ do@@ l . &quot;
I don &apos;t know .
I &apos;m con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed that there &apos;s some sort of p@@ ul@@ l to n@@ os@@ tal@@ gi@@ a , to wis@@ h@@ ful thinking .
And I understand that .
I &apos;m not part of that c@@ ro@@ w@@ d , I have to say .
I don &apos;t want to go back , and it &apos;s not because I &apos;m ad@@ v@@ ent@@ ur@@ ous .
It &apos;s because possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ties on this planet , they don &apos;t go back , they go for@@ ward .
So I want to get in the ma@@ ch@@ ine , and I want to go for@@ ward .
This is the gre@@ at@@ est time there &apos;s ever been on this planet by any me@@ as@@ ure that you wis@@ h to cho@@ ose : heal@@ th , we@@ al@@ th , mo@@ bi@@ li@@ ty , op@@ port@@ unity , de@@ c@@ lin@@ ing r@@ ates of dis@@ e@@ ase ...
There &apos;s never been a time like this .
My gre@@ at@@ -@@ gr@@ and@@ par@@ ents di@@ ed , all of them , by the time they were 6@@ 0 .
My gr@@ and@@ par@@ ents p@@ us@@ h@@ ed that number to 7@@ 0 .
My par@@ ents are cl@@ os@@ ing in on 8@@ 0 .
So there better be a n@@ ine at the beg@@ inn@@ ing of my de@@ at@@ h number .
But it &apos;s not even about people like us , because this is a b@@ ig@@ ger de@@ al than that .
A k@@ id bor@@ n in New D@@ el@@ h@@ i today can exp@@ ect to live as long as the ri@@ ch@@ est man in the world did 100 years ago .
Th@@ in@@ k about that , it &apos;s an incre@@ di@@ ble fact .
And why is it tr@@ ue ?
S@@ m@@ all@@ po@@ x . S@@ m@@ all@@ po@@ x k@@ ill@@ ed b@@ illi@@ ons of people on this planet .
It res@@ h@@ ap@@ ed the de@@ m@@ ograp@@ h@@ y of the g@@ lo@@ be in a way that no war ever has .
It &apos;s g@@ one . It &apos;s v@@ an@@ is@@ h@@ ed .
We v@@ an@@ qu@@ is@@ h@@ ed it . P@@ u@@ ff .
In the r@@ ich world , dis@@ eas@@ es that th@@ re@@ at@@ en@@ ed m@@ illi@@ ons of us just a gener@@ ation ago no l@@ on@@ ger ex@@ ist , har@@ d@@ ly .
Di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ a , ru@@ b@@ ell@@ a , poli@@ o ...
does any@@ one even know what those things are ?
V@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ es , mo@@ dern medi@@ c@@ ine , our abili@@ ty to fe@@ ed b@@ illi@@ ons of people , those are tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s of the sci@@ enti@@ fi@@ c me@@ th@@ od .
And to my m@@ ind , the sci@@ enti@@ fi@@ c me@@ th@@ od -- trying stuff out , se@@ eing if it wor@@ ks , chan@@ ging it when it doesn &apos;t -- is one of the great ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ m@@ ents of hum@@ an@@ ity .
So that &apos;s the good ne@@ ws .
Un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ at@@ ely , that &apos;s all the good ne@@ ws because there are some other proble@@ ms , and they &apos;ve been men@@ tion@@ ed many times .
And one of them is that des@@ pi@@ te all our ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh@@ m@@ ents , a b@@ illion people go to b@@ ed h@@ un@@ gr@@ y in this world every day .
That number &apos;s ris@@ ing , and it &apos;s ris@@ ing really rap@@ i@@ d@@ ly , and it &apos;s dis@@ gra@@ ce@@ ful .
And not only that , we &apos;ve used our ima@@ g@@ in@@ ation to th@@ or@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly tr@@ as@@ h this g@@ lo@@ be .
P@@ ot@@ able water , ar@@ able land , ra@@ in@@ for@@ es@@ ts , o@@ il , g@@ as : they &apos;re going away , and they &apos;re going away so@@ on , and un@@ less we in@@ nov@@ ate our way out of this m@@ ess , we &apos;re going away too .
So the question is : C@@ an we do that ? And I think we can .
I think it &apos;s cle@@ ar that we can make food that will fe@@ ed b@@ illi@@ ons of people with@@ out rap@@ ing the land that they live on .
I think we can power this world with energy that doesn &apos;t also des@@ tro@@ y it .
I really do believe that , and , no , it ain &apos;t wis@@ h@@ ful thinking .
But here &apos;s the thing that ke@@ ep@@ s me up at ni@@ ght -- one of the things that ke@@ ep@@ s me up at ni@@ ght : We &apos;ve never nee@@ ded pro@@ g@@ res@@ s in sci@@ ence more than we need it right now . N@@ ever .
And we &apos;ve also never been in a posi@@ tion to de@@ p@@ lo@@ y it pro@@ per@@ ly in the way that we can today .
We &apos;re on the ver@@ ge of a@@ ma@@ zing , a@@ ma@@ zing ev@@ ents in many fi@@ el@@ ds , and y@@ et I actually think we &apos;d have to go back h@@ und@@ re@@ ds , 3@@ 00 years , before the En@@ li@@ gh@@ ten@@ ment , to find a time when we b@@ att@@ l@@ ed pro@@ g@@ res@@ s , when we f@@ ou@@ ght about these things more vi@@ g@@ or@@ ous@@ ly , on more f@@ ron@@ ts , than we do now .
P@@ e@@ ople w@@ ra@@ p the@@ m@@ selves in their belie@@ f@@ s , and they do it so ti@@ gh@@ tly that you can &apos;t set them f@@ ree .
N@@ ot even the tru@@ th will set them f@@ ree .
And , li@@ sten , every@@ one &apos;s enti@@ t@@ l@@ ed to their op@@ ini@@ on ; they &apos;re even enti@@ t@@ l@@ ed to their op@@ ini@@ on about pro@@ g@@ res@@ s .
But you know what you &apos;re not enti@@ t@@ l@@ ed to ?
You &apos;re not enti@@ t@@ l@@ ed to your own fac@@ ts . S@@ or@@ ry , you &apos;re not .
And this took me a@@ whi@@ le to fig@@ ure out .
Ab@@ out a de@@ c@@ ade ago , I w@@ ro@@ te a story about v@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ es for The New Yor@@ ker . A little story .
And I was a@@ ma@@ zed to find op@@ posi@@ tion : op@@ posi@@ tion to what is , after all , the most eff@@ ec@@ tive publi@@ c heal@@ th me@@ as@@ ure in human hist@@ ory .
I didn &apos;t know what to do , so I just did what I do : I w@@ ro@@ te a story and I mo@@ ved on .
And so@@ on after that , I w@@ ro@@ te a story about gen@@ e@@ tic@@ ally eng@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ed food .
S@@ ame thing , only b@@ ig@@ ger .
P@@ e@@ ople were going cra@@ z@@ y .
So I w@@ ro@@ te a story about that too , and I cou@@ ldn &apos;t understand why people thought this was &quot; F@@ ran@@ ken@@ fo@@ o@@ ds , &quot; why they thought mo@@ ving m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ul@@ es around in a spec@@ i@@ fi@@ c , ra@@ ther than a h@@ ap@@ ha@@ z@@ ard way , was tr@@ es@@ p@@ ass@@ ing on nat@@ ure &apos;s gro@@ und .
But , you know , I do what I do . I w@@ ro@@ te the story , I mo@@ ved on .
I mean , I &apos;m a j@@ our@@ n@@ al@@ ist .
We t@@ yp@@ e , we fi@@ le , we go to d@@ inn@@ er . It &apos;s f@@ ine .
But these stor@@ ies bo@@ ther@@ ed me , and I cou@@ ldn &apos;t fig@@ ure out why , and ev@@ ent@@ u@@ ally I did .
And that &apos;s because those fan@@ ati@@ c@@ s that were dri@@ ving me cra@@ z@@ y wer@@ en &apos;t actually fan@@ ati@@ c@@ s at all .
They were thou@@ gh@@ t@@ ful people , e@@ duc@@ ated people , de@@ c@@ ent people .
They were ex@@ ac@@ tly like the people in this ro@@ om .
And it just dis@@ tur@@ b@@ ed me so much .
But then I thought , you know , let &apos;s be h@@ on@@ est .
We &apos;re at a point in this world where we don &apos;t have the same rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p to pro@@ g@@ res@@ s that we used to .
We talk about it am@@ bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ly .
We talk about it in ir@@ on@@ ic ter@@ ms with little quot@@ es around it : &quot; pro@@ g@@ res@@ s . &quot;
Okay , there are reas@@ ons for that , and I think we know what those reas@@ ons are .
We &apos;ve l@@ ost fa@@ it@@ h in in@@ sti@@ tu@@ tions , in au@@ th@@ or@@ ity , and some@@ times in sci@@ ence it@@ self , and there &apos;s no reas@@ on we sh@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t have .
You can just say a few nam@@ es and people will understand .
C@@ her@@ no@@ b@@ y@@ l , B@@ hop@@ al , the Ch@@ all@@ en@@ ger , Vi@@ o@@ x@@ x , we@@ ap@@ ons of m@@ ass des@@ tru@@ c@@ tion , h@@ an@@ ging ch@@ a@@ ds .
You know , you can cho@@ ose your li@@ st .
There are ques@@ tions and proble@@ ms with the people we used to believe were always right , so be sk@@ ep@@ tical .
A@@ s@@ k ques@@ tions , de@@ m@@ and pro@@ of , de@@ m@@ and e@@ vi@@ den@@ ce .
D@@ on &apos;t take anything for gr@@ an@@ ted .
But here &apos;s the thing : When you get pro@@ of , you need to ac@@ ce@@ pt the pro@@ of , and we &apos;re not that good at doing that .
And the reas@@ on that I can say that is because we &apos;re now in an e@@ pi@@ de@@ mi@@ c of fe@@ ar like one I &apos;ve never se@@ en and hop@@ e never to see again .
Ab@@ out 1@@ 2 years ago , there was a story publi@@ sh@@ ed , a h@@ or@@ ri@@ ble story , that lin@@ ked the e@@ pi@@ de@@ mi@@ c of au@@ ti@@ s@@ m to the me@@ as@@ les , m@@ um@@ ps and ru@@ b@@ ell@@ a v@@ ac@@ c@@ ine sho@@ t .
Ver@@ y sc@@ ary .
T@@ ons of stu@@ dies were done to see if this was tr@@ ue .
T@@ ons of stu@@ dies should have been done ; it &apos;s a s@@ eri@@ ous is@@ su@@ e .
The data came back .
The data came back from the Un@@ ited St@@ ates , from En@@ gl@@ and , from S@@ we@@ den , from C@@ an@@ ad@@ a , and it was all the same : no cor@@ rel@@ ation , no connec@@ tion , n@@ one at all .
It doesn &apos;t mat@@ ter . It doesn &apos;t mat@@ ter because we believe an@@ ec@@ d@@ ot@@ es , we believe what we see , what we think we see , what ma@@ kes us feel real .
We don &apos;t believe a b@@ un@@ ch of do@@ c@@ um@@ ents from a go@@ vern@@ ment off@@ ic@@ i@@ al gi@@ ving us data , and I do understand that , I think we all do .
But you know what ?
The res@@ ul@@ t of that has been dis@@ a@@ str@@ ous .
D@@ is@@ a@@ str@@ ous because here &apos;s a fact : The Un@@ ited St@@ ates is one of the only coun@@ tri@@ es in the world where the v@@ ac@@ c@@ ine ra@@ te for me@@ as@@ les is going down .
That is dis@@ gra@@ ce@@ ful , and we should be as@@ h@@ am@@ ed of our@@ selves .
It &apos;s h@@ or@@ ri@@ ble .
What kind of a thing happened that we could do that ?
Now , I understand it . I do understand it .
Because , did any@@ one have me@@ as@@ les here ?
H@@ as one person in this au@@ di@@ ence ever se@@ en some@@ one die of me@@ as@@ les ?
D@@ o@@ esn &apos;t happ@@ en very much .
D@@ o@@ esn &apos;t happ@@ en in this country at all , but it happened 1@@ 6@@ 0@@ ,000 times in the world last year .
That &apos;s a lot of de@@ at@@ h of me@@ as@@ les -- 20 an h@@ our .
But sin@@ ce it didn &apos;t happ@@ en here , we can put it out of our min@@ ds , and people like J@@ en@@ n@@ y M@@ c@@ C@@ ar@@ th@@ y can go around pre@@ ach@@ ing m@@ es@@ sa@@ ges of fe@@ ar and illi@@ ter@@ ac@@ y from pl@@ at@@ for@@ ms like &quot; O@@ p@@ ra@@ h &quot; and &quot; L@@ ar@@ ry K@@ ing Li@@ ve . &quot;
And they can do it because they don &apos;t lin@@ k c@@ au@@ sa@@ tion and cor@@ rel@@ ation .
They don &apos;t understand that these things se@@ em the same , but they &apos;re al@@ most never the same .
And it &apos;s something we need to lear@@ n , and we need to lear@@ n it really so@@ on .
This gu@@ y was a her@@ o , J@@ on@@ as S@@ alk .
He took one of the wor@@ st sc@@ our@@ ges of man@@ kind away from us .
No fe@@ ar , no ag@@ on@@ y . Po@@ li@@ o -- pu@@ ff , g@@ one .
That gu@@ y in the mi@@ dd@@ le , not so much .
H@@ is n@@ ame is P@@ au@@ l O@@ ff@@ it .
He just develop@@ ed a r@@ ot@@ avi@@ r@@ us v@@ ac@@ c@@ ine with a b@@ un@@ ch of other people .
It &apos;ll sa@@ ve the li@@ ves of 4@@ 00 to 5@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,000 kids in the develop@@ ing world every year .
P@@ re@@ tty good , right ?
Well , it &apos;s good , ex@@ ce@@ pt that P@@ au@@ l go@@ es around talking about v@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ es and says how val@@ u@@ able they are and that people ou@@ ght to just sto@@ p the wh@@ in@@ ing .
And he actually says it that way .
So , P@@ au@@ l &apos;s a ter@@ r@@ or@@ ist .
When P@@ au@@ l spe@@ a@@ ks in a publi@@ c hear@@ ing , he can &apos;t t@@ es@@ ti@@ f@@ y with@@ out ar@@ m@@ ed gu@@ ar@@ ds .
He ge@@ ts called at h@@ ome because people like to tell him that they re@@ mem@@ ber where his kids go to school .
And why ? Because P@@ au@@ l made a v@@ ac@@ c@@ ine .
I don &apos;t need to say this , but v@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ es are ess@@ enti@@ al .
You take them away , dis@@ e@@ ase comes back , h@@ or@@ ri@@ ble dis@@ eas@@ es . And that &apos;s happen@@ ing .
We have me@@ as@@ les in this country now .
And it &apos;s getting wor@@ se , and pretty so@@ on kids are going to die of it again because it &apos;s just a num@@ ber@@ s g@@ ame .
And they &apos;re not just going to die of me@@ as@@ les .
What about poli@@ o ? L@@ et &apos;s have that . Wh@@ y not ?
A col@@ le@@ ge cl@@ ass@@ ma@@ te of m@@ ine w@@ ro@@ te me a cou@@ ple we@@ e@@ ks ago and said she thought I was a little stri@@ d@@ ent .
No one &apos;s ever said that before .
S@@ he w@@ as@@ n &apos;t going to v@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ ate her k@@ id ag@@ a@@ in@@ st poli@@ o , no way .
F@@ ine .
Wh@@ y ? Because we don &apos;t have poli@@ o . And you know what ?
We didn &apos;t have poli@@ o in this country y@@ es@@ ter@@ day .
To@@ day , I don &apos;t know , maybe a gu@@ y got on a plan@@ e in L@@ a@@ go@@ s this mor@@ ning , and he &apos;s fl@@ ying to L@@ A@@ X , right now he &apos;s over O@@ hi@@ o .
And he &apos;s going to land in a cou@@ ple of h@@ our@@ s , he &apos;s going to r@@ ent a c@@ ar , and he &apos;s going to come to L@@ ong Be@@ ach , and he &apos;s going to att@@ end one of these f@@ ab@@ ul@@ ous TED d@@ inn@@ ers t@@ on@@ i@@ ght .
And he doesn &apos;t know that he &apos;s in@@ f@@ ec@@ ted with a par@@ al@@ y@@ tic dis@@ e@@ ase , and we don &apos;t ei@@ ther because that &apos;s the way the world wor@@ ks .
That &apos;s the planet we live on . D@@ on &apos;t pre@@ t@@ end it is@@ n &apos;t .
Now , we love to w@@ ra@@ p our@@ selves in li@@ es . We love to do it .
E@@ very@@ one take their v@@ it@@ am@@ ins this mor@@ ning ?
E@@ ch@@ in@@ ac@@ e@@ a , a little an@@ ti@@ o@@ x@@ i@@ d@@ ant to get you going .
I know you did because hal@@ f of A@@ mer@@ ic@@ ans do every day .
They take the stuff , and they take al@@ ter@@ n@@ ative medi@@ c@@ in@@ es , and it doesn &apos;t mat@@ ter how o@@ ften we find out that they &apos;re us@@ el@@ ess .
The data says it all the time .
They dar@@ ken your ur@@ ine . They al@@ most never do more than that .
It &apos;s ok@@ ay , you want to p@@ ay 2@@ 8 b@@ illion dollars for dar@@ k ur@@ ine ?
I &apos;m t@@ ot@@ ally with you .
D@@ ar@@ k ur@@ ine . D@@ ar@@ k .
Wh@@ y do we do that ? Wh@@ y do we do that ?
Well , I think I understand , we ha@@ te Bi@@ g P@@ har@@ ma .
We ha@@ te Bi@@ g Go@@ vern@@ ment . We don &apos;t tr@@ ust the Man .
And we sh@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t : O@@ ur heal@@ th c@@ are system su@@ cks .
It &apos;s c@@ ru@@ el to m@@ illi@@ ons of people .
It &apos;s ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely ast@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing@@ ly c@@ old and s@@ ou@@ l@@ -@@ ben@@ ding to those of us who can even aff@@ or@@ d it .
So we ru@@ n away from it , and where do we ru@@ n ?
We lea@@ p into the ar@@ ms of Bi@@ g Pl@@ ac@@ e@@ b@@ o .
That &apos;s fan@@ t@@ as@@ tic . I love Bi@@ g Pl@@ ac@@ e@@ b@@ o .
But , you know , it &apos;s really a s@@ eri@@ ous thing because this stuff is cra@@ p , and we sp@@ end b@@ illi@@ ons of dollars on it .
And I have all sor@@ ts of little pro@@ ps here .
N@@ one of it ... g@@ in@@ k@@ go , f@@ r@@ au@@ d ; e@@ ch@@ in@@ ac@@ e@@ a , f@@ r@@ au@@ d ; ac@@ a@@ i -- I don &apos;t even know what that is but we &apos;re sp@@ en@@ ding b@@ illi@@ ons of dollars on it -- it &apos;s f@@ r@@ au@@ d .
And you know what ? When I say this stuff , people s@@ cre@@ am at me , and they say , &quot; What do you c@@ are ? L@@ et people do what they want to do .
It ma@@ kes them feel good . &quot;
And you know what ? You &apos;re w@@ r@@ ong .
Because I don &apos;t c@@ are if it &apos;s the s@@ ec@@ re@@ t@@ ary of H@@ H@@ S who &apos;s sa@@ ying , &quot; H@@ m@@ m , I &apos;m not going to take the e@@ vi@@ den@@ ce of my exper@@ ts on ma@@ mm@@ og@@ ra@@ ms , &quot; or some can@@ c@@ er qu@@ ack who wan@@ ts to tre@@ at his pa@@ ti@@ ent with co@@ ff@@ e@@ e en@@ em@@ as .
When you start down the ro@@ ad where belie@@ f and ma@@ gi@@ c re@@ place e@@ vi@@ den@@ ce and sci@@ ence , you end up in a place you don &apos;t want to be .
You end up in Th@@ ab@@ o M@@ be@@ k@@ i S@@ ou@@ th Africa .
He k@@ ill@@ ed 4@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,000 of his people by in@@ s@@ is@@ ting that be@@ et@@ ro@@ ot , g@@ ar@@ li@@ c and le@@ m@@ on o@@ il were much more eff@@ ec@@ tive than the an@@ ti@@ re@@ tro@@ vi@@ ra@@ l dru@@ gs we know can s@@ low the course of A@@ I@@ D@@ S .
H@@ und@@ re@@ ds of thou@@ s@@ and@@ s of nee@@ d@@ less de@@ a@@ ths in a country that has been pl@@ ag@@ u@@ ed wor@@ se than any other by this dis@@ e@@ ase .
P@@ le@@ ase , don &apos;t tell me there are no con@@ se@@ qu@@ en@@ ces to these things .
There are . There always are .
Now , the most min@@ d@@ less e@@ pi@@ de@@ mi@@ c we &apos;re in the mi@@ dd@@ le of right now is this ab@@ sur@@ d b@@ att@@ le between pro@@ pon@@ ents of gen@@ e@@ tic@@ ally eng@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ed food and the organ@@ ic e@@ li@@ te .
It &apos;s an i@@ di@@ o@@ tic de@@ b@@ ate . It has to sto@@ p .
It &apos;s a de@@ b@@ ate about wor@@ ds , about m@@ et@@ ap@@ h@@ ors .
It &apos;s ide@@ olog@@ y , it &apos;s not sci@@ ence .
E@@ very s@@ ing@@ le thing we e@@ at , every gra@@ in of ri@@ ce , every sp@@ ri@@ g of par@@ s@@ le@@ y , every Br@@ us@@ sel@@ s spr@@ out has been mo@@ di@@ fi@@ ed by man .
You know , there wer@@ en &apos;t t@@ an@@ ger@@ in@@ es in the g@@ ar@@ den of E@@ den .
There w@@ as@@ n &apos;t any can@@ tal@@ ou@@ p@@ e . There wer@@ en &apos;t Chr@@ ist@@ m@@ as tre@@ es . We made it all .
We made it over the last 1@@ 1@@ ,000 years .
And some of it wor@@ ked , and some of it didn &apos;t .
We got ri@@ d of the stuff that didn &apos;t .
Now we can do it in a more pre@@ c@@ is@@ e way -- and there are ris@@ ks , ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely -- but we can put something like v@@ it@@ am@@ in A into ri@@ ce , and that stuff can help m@@ illi@@ ons of people , m@@ illi@@ ons of people , pro@@ long their li@@ ves .
You don &apos;t want to do that ?
I have to say , I don &apos;t understand it .
We ob@@ ject to gen@@ e@@ tic@@ ally eng@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ed food .
Wh@@ y do we do that ?
Well , the things I con@@ st@@ ant@@ ly he@@ ar are : To@@ o many ch@@ em@@ ic@@ als , p@@ es@@ ti@@ ci@@ des , h@@ or@@ mon@@ es , mon@@ o@@ cul@@ ture , we don &apos;t want gi@@ ant fi@@ el@@ ds of the same thing , that &apos;s w@@ r@@ ong .
We don &apos;t comp@@ an@@ ies pat@@ ent@@ ing life .
We don &apos;t want comp@@ an@@ ies o@@ w@@ ning se@@ e@@ ds .
And you know what my res@@ pon@@ se to all of that is ?
Y@@ es , you &apos;re right . L@@ et &apos;s fi@@ x it .
It &apos;s tr@@ ue , we &apos;ve got a hu@@ ge food problem , but this is@@ n &apos;t sci@@ ence .
This has no@@ thing to do with sci@@ ence .
It &apos;s la@@ w , it &apos;s mor@@ ality , it &apos;s pat@@ ent stuff .
You know sci@@ ence is@@ n &apos;t a comp@@ any .
It &apos;s not a country .
It &apos;s not even an idea ; it &apos;s a pro@@ cess .
It &apos;s a pro@@ cess , and some@@ times it wor@@ ks and some@@ times it doesn &apos;t , but the idea that we should not al@@ low sci@@ ence to do its j@@ ob because we &apos;re a@@ fra@@ id , is really very de@@ a@@ den@@ ing , and it &apos;s pre@@ v@@ ent@@ ing m@@ illi@@ ons of people from pr@@ os@@ per@@ ing .
You know , in the next 50 years we &apos;re going to have to gro@@ w 7@@ 0 percent more food than we do right now , 7@@ 0 percent .
This inv@@ est@@ ment in Africa over the last 30 years .
D@@ is@@ gra@@ ce@@ ful . D@@ is@@ gra@@ ce@@ ful .
They need it , and we &apos;re not gi@@ ving it to them .
And why ? Gen@@ e@@ tic@@ ally eng@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ed food .
We don &apos;t want to en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge people to e@@ at that r@@ ot@@ ten stuff , like c@@ as@@ sa@@ v@@ a for in@@ st@@ ance .
C@@ as@@ sa@@ v@@ a &apos;s something that hal@@ f a b@@ illion people e@@ at .
It &apos;s kind of like a p@@ ot@@ a@@ to .
It &apos;s just a b@@ un@@ ch of c@@ al@@ or@@ ies . It su@@ cks .
It doesn &apos;t have n@@ ut@@ ri@@ ents , it doesn &apos;t have pr@@ ot@@ ein , and sci@@ enti@@ st@@ s are eng@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ing all of that into it right now .
And then people would be able to e@@ at it and they &apos;d be able to not go bl@@ ind .
They w@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t star@@ ve , and you know what ?
That would be ni@@ ce . It w@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t be C@@ he@@ z P@@ an@@ is@@ se , but it would be ni@@ ce .
And all I can say about this is : Wh@@ y are we fi@@ gh@@ ting it ?
I mean , let &apos;s ask our@@ selves : Wh@@ y are we fi@@ gh@@ ting it ?
Because we don &apos;t want to mo@@ ve gen@@ es around ?
This is about mo@@ ving gen@@ es around . It &apos;s not about ch@@ em@@ ic@@ als .
It &apos;s not about our ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous passi@@ on for h@@ or@@ mon@@ es , our in@@ s@@ ist@@ ence on ha@@ ving b@@ ig@@ ger food , better food , s@@ ing@@ ular food .
This is@@ n &apos;t about Ri@@ ce K@@ ris@@ pi@@ es , this is about ke@@ ep@@ ing people ali@@ ve , and it &apos;s about time we started to understand what that me@@ ant .
Because , you know something ?
If we don &apos;t , if we con@@ tin@@ ue to act the way we &apos;re ac@@ ting , we &apos;re gu@@ il@@ ty of something that I don &apos;t think we want to be gu@@ il@@ ty of : high@@ -@@ te@@ ch col@@ on@@ i@@ alis@@ m .
There &apos;s no other way to des@@ cri@@ be what &apos;s going on here .
It &apos;s sel@@ f@@ ish , it &apos;s u@@ g@@ ly , it &apos;s ben@@ e@@ at@@ h us , and we really have to sto@@ p it .
So after this a@@ ma@@ z@@ ing@@ ly f@@ un con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion , you might want to say , &quot; So , you still want to get in this ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous time ma@@ ch@@ ine and go for@@ ward ? &quot;
Ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely . Ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely , I do .
It &apos;s stu@@ ck in the pres@@ ent right now , but we have an a@@ ma@@ zing op@@ port@@ unity .
We can set that time ma@@ ch@@ ine on anything we want .
We can mo@@ ve it where we want to mo@@ ve it , and we &apos;re going to mo@@ ve it where we want to mo@@ ve it .
We have to have these con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tions and we have to think , but when we get in the time ma@@ ch@@ ine and we go ah@@ e@@ ad , we &apos;re going to be happ@@ y we do .
I know that we can , and as f@@ ar as I &apos;m con@@ cer@@ ned , that &apos;s something the world nee@@ ds right now .
Thank you .
One day , L@@ os An@@ gel@@ es T@@ im@@ es col@@ um@@ n@@ ist S@@ te@@ ve L@@ op@@ e@@ z was w@@ al@@ king al@@ ong the stre@@ ets of do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn L@@ os An@@ gel@@ es when he hear@@ d beau@@ ti@@ ful mus@@ ic .
And the s@@ our@@ ce was a man , an Afri@@ can@@ -@@ Ameri@@ can man , char@@ m@@ ing , ru@@ g@@ g@@ ed , h@@ om@@ el@@ ess , pla@@ ying a vi@@ o@@ li@@ n that only had two str@@ ings .
And I &apos;m tell@@ ing a story that many of you know , because S@@ te@@ ve &apos;s col@@ um@@ ns bec@@ ame the bas@@ is for a book , which was tur@@ ned into a mo@@ v@@ ie , with Ro@@ ber@@ t D@@ o@@ w@@ ne@@ y J@@ r@@ . ac@@ ting as S@@ te@@ ve L@@ op@@ e@@ z , and J@@ am@@ ie F@@ o@@ x@@ x as N@@ a@@ th@@ ani@@ el An@@ th@@ on@@ y A@@ y@@ ers , the J@@ u@@ illi@@ ar@@ d@@ -@@ tra@@ in@@ ed d@@ ou@@ ble b@@ ass@@ ist wh@@ ose pro@@ mis@@ ing car@@ e@@ er was c@@ ut sh@@ ort by a tra@@ gi@@ c aff@@ lic@@ tion with par@@ an@@ o@@ id schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ i@@ a .
N@@ a@@ th@@ ani@@ el dro@@ pp@@ ed out of J@@ u@@ illi@@ ard , he su@@ ff@@ er@@ ed a comp@@ le@@ te bre@@ ak@@ down , and 30 years l@@ ater he was li@@ ving h@@ om@@ el@@ ess on the stre@@ ets of S@@ k@@ id R@@ ow in do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn L@@ os An@@ gel@@ es .
I en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge all of you to re@@ ad S@@ te@@ ve &apos;s book or to wat@@ ch the mo@@ v@@ ie to understand not only the beau@@ ti@@ ful b@@ on@@ d that for@@ m@@ ed between these two men , but how mus@@ ic hel@@ p@@ ed sh@@ ap@@ e that b@@ on@@ d , and ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely was in@@ str@@ um@@ ent@@ al -- if you &apos;ll par@@ don the p@@ un -- in hel@@ p@@ ing N@@ a@@ th@@ ani@@ el get off the stre@@ ets .
I me@@ t M@@ r@@ . A@@ y@@ ers in 200@@ 8 , two years ago , at W@@ alt D@@ is@@ ne@@ y C@@ on@@ c@@ ert H@@ all .
He had just hear@@ d a per@@ for@@ man@@ ce of Be@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ ven &apos;s F@@ ir@@ st and F@@ our@@ th sy@@ m@@ ph@@ on@@ ies , and came b@@ ack@@ st@@ age and in@@ tro@@ duc@@ ed hi@@ m@@ self .
He was spe@@ a@@ king in a very j@@ o@@ vi@@ al and gre@@ g@@ ari@@ ous way about Y@@ o@@ -@@ Y@@ o M@@ a and H@@ ill@@ ary C@@ lin@@ ton and how the D@@ o@@ d@@ g@@ ers were never going to make the Wor@@ ld S@@ eri@@ es , all because of the tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous first vi@@ o@@ li@@ n p@@ as@@ sage work in the last mo@@ v@@ em@@ ent of Be@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ ven &apos;s F@@ our@@ th Sy@@ m@@ ph@@ on@@ y .
And we got talking about mus@@ ic , and I got an e@@ ma@@ il from S@@ te@@ ve a few da@@ ys l@@ ater sa@@ ying that N@@ a@@ th@@ ani@@ el was interes@@ ted in a vi@@ o@@ li@@ n l@@ ess@@ on with me .
Now , I should men@@ tion that N@@ a@@ th@@ ani@@ el re@@ f@@ us@@ es tre@@ at@@ ment because when he was tre@@ ated it was with sho@@ ck ther@@ ap@@ y and Th@@ or@@ a@@ z@@ ine and hand@@ c@@ u@@ ff@@ s , and that sc@@ ar has sta@@ y@@ ed with him for his enti@@ re life .
But as a res@@ ul@@ t now , he is pr@@ one to these schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ en@@ ic ep@@ is@@ o@@ des , the wor@@ st of which can man@@ i@@ f@@ est the@@ m@@ selves as him exp@@ lo@@ ding and then dis@@ ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ing for da@@ ys , w@@ ander@@ ing the stre@@ ets of S@@ k@@ id R@@ ow , ex@@ pos@@ ed to its h@@ or@@ r@@ ors , with the t@@ or@@ ment of his own m@@ ind un@@ le@@ as@@ h@@ ed up@@ on him .
And N@@ a@@ th@@ ani@@ el was in such a st@@ ate of ag@@ it@@ ation when we started our first l@@ ess@@ on at W@@ alt D@@ is@@ ne@@ y C@@ on@@ c@@ ert H@@ all -- he had a kind of man@@ ic gl@@ int in his e@@ y@@ es , he was l@@ ost .
And he was talking about inv@@ isi@@ ble de@@ mon@@ s and s@@ mo@@ ke , and how some@@ one was po@@ is@@ on@@ ing him in his s@@ le@@ ep .
And I was a@@ fra@@ id , not for my@@ self , but I was a@@ fra@@ id that I was going to l@@ ose him , that he was going to sin@@ k into one of his st@@ ates , and that I would ru@@ in his rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p with the vi@@ o@@ li@@ n if I started talking about sc@@ al@@ es and ar@@ pe@@ g@@ gi@@ os and other ex@@ c@@ it@@ ing for@@ ms of di@@ d@@ ac@@ tic vi@@ o@@ li@@ n pe@@ da@@ go@@ g@@ y .
So , I just started pla@@ ying .
And I pla@@ y@@ ed the first mo@@ v@@ em@@ ent of the Be@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ ven Vi@@ o@@ li@@ n C@@ on@@ cer@@ to .
And as I pla@@ y@@ ed , I under@@ sto@@ od that there was a pro@@ found change o@@ c@@ cur@@ r@@ ing in N@@ a@@ th@@ ani@@ el &apos;s e@@ y@@ es .
It was as if he was in the g@@ ri@@ p of some inv@@ isi@@ ble ph@@ ar@@ ma@@ c@@ eu@@ tical , a ch@@ em@@ ic@@ al re@@ ac@@ tion , for which my pla@@ ying the mus@@ ic was its c@@ at@@ al@@ y@@ st .
And N@@ a@@ th@@ ani@@ el &apos;s man@@ ic ra@@ ge was trans@@ for@@ m@@ ed into under@@ stand@@ ing , a qui@@ et c@@ u@@ ri@@ os@@ ity and gra@@ ce .
And in a mi@@ ra@@ c@@ le , he li@@ f@@ ted his own vi@@ o@@ li@@ n and he started pla@@ ying , by e@@ ar , cer@@ tain s@@ ni@@ pp@@ ets of vi@@ o@@ li@@ n con@@ cer@@ to@@ s which he then as@@ ked me to comp@@ le@@ te -- Men@@ d@@ el@@ s@@ so@@ h@@ n , T@@ ch@@ a@@ i@@ k@@ o@@ v@@ sk@@ y , Si@@ be@@ li@@ us .
And we started talking about mus@@ ic , from B@@ ach to Be@@ e@@ th@@ o@@ ven and B@@ ra@@ h@@ ms , B@@ ru@@ ck@@ ner , all the B &apos;s , from B@@ ar@@ t@@ ó@@ k , all the way up to E@@ sa@@ -@@ P@@ ek@@ ka S@@ al@@ onen .
And I under@@ sto@@ od that he not only had an en@@ c@@ y@@ c@@ lo@@ pe@@ di@@ c kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge of mus@@ ic , but he rel@@ ated to this mus@@ ic at a per@@ son@@ al le@@ v@@ el .
He sp@@ o@@ ke about it with the kind of passi@@ on and under@@ stand@@ ing that I sh@@ are with my col@@ le@@ ag@@ u@@ es in the L@@ os An@@ gel@@ es Ph@@ il@@ har@@ mon@@ ic .
And through pla@@ ying mus@@ ic and talking about mus@@ ic , this man had trans@@ for@@ m@@ ed from the par@@ an@@ o@@ id , dis@@ tur@@ b@@ ed man that had just come from w@@ al@@ king the stre@@ ets of do@@ w@@ n@@ to@@ wn L@@ os An@@ gel@@ es to the char@@ m@@ ing , er@@ u@@ di@@ te , bri@@ lli@@ ant , J@@ u@@ illi@@ ar@@ d@@ -@@ tra@@ in@@ ed mus@@ ic@@ i@@ an .
M@@ us@@ ic is medi@@ c@@ ine . M@@ us@@ ic chan@@ ges us .
And for N@@ a@@ th@@ ani@@ el , mus@@ ic is s@@ an@@ ity .
Because mus@@ ic al@@ lo@@ ws him to take his thou@@ gh@@ ts and d@@ el@@ usi@@ ons and sh@@ ap@@ e them through his ima@@ g@@ in@@ ation and his cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity , into re@@ ality .
And that is an es@@ cap@@ e from his t@@ or@@ ment@@ ed st@@ ate .
And I under@@ sto@@ od that this was the very ess@@ ence of art .
This was the very reas@@ on why we made mus@@ ic , that we take something that ex@@ is@@ ts with@@ in all of us at our very f@@ und@@ am@@ ent@@ al cor@@ e , our em@@ o@@ tions , and through our arti@@ sti@@ c l@@ ens , through our cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity , we &apos;re able to sh@@ ap@@ e those em@@ o@@ tions into re@@ ality .
And the re@@ ality of that ex@@ pres@@ sion re@@ ach@@ es all of us and mo@@ ves us , in@@ sp@@ ir@@ es and un@@ it@@ es us .
And for N@@ a@@ th@@ ani@@ el , mus@@ ic br@@ ou@@ ght him back into a f@@ old of fri@@ ends .
The re@@ de@@ mp@@ tive power of mus@@ ic br@@ ou@@ ght him back into a fam@@ ily of mus@@ ic@@ i@@ ans that under@@ sto@@ od him , that rec@@ og@@ ni@@ zed his tal@@ ents and res@@ p@@ ec@@ ted him .
And I will always make mus@@ ic with N@@ a@@ th@@ ani@@ el , wh@@ e@@ ther we &apos;re at W@@ alt D@@ is@@ ne@@ y C@@ on@@ c@@ ert H@@ all or on S@@ k@@ id R@@ ow , because he re@@ min@@ ds me why I bec@@ ame a mus@@ ic@@ i@@ an .
Thank you .
Br@@ un@@ o G@@ i@@ us@@ s@@ an@@ i : Thank you . Th@@ an@@ ks .
Ro@@ ber@@ t G@@ up@@ t@@ a .
Ro@@ ber@@ t G@@ up@@ t@@ a : I &apos;m going to play something that I sh@@ am@@ el@@ ess@@ ly st@@ ole from c@@ el@@ li@@ st@@ s .
So , ple@@ ase for@@ give me .
I &apos;m J@@ an@@ e M@@ c@@ G@@ on@@ ig@@ al . I &apos;m a g@@ ame desig@@ ner .
I &apos;ve been making g@@ am@@ es on@@ line now for 10 years , and my go@@ al for the next de@@ c@@ ade is to try to make it as eas@@ y to sa@@ ve the world in real life as it is to sa@@ ve the world in on@@ line g@@ am@@ es .
Now , I have a pl@@ an for this , and it ent@@ a@@ il@@ s con@@ v@@ inc@@ ing more people , inc@@ lu@@ ding all of you , to sp@@ end more time pla@@ ying b@@ ig@@ ger and better g@@ am@@ es .
Ri@@ ght now we sp@@ end three b@@ illion h@@ our@@ s a we@@ e@@ k pla@@ ying on@@ line g@@ am@@ es .
S@@ ome of you might be thinking , &quot; That &apos;s a lot of time to sp@@ end pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es .
Ma@@ ybe too much time , con@@ si@@ der@@ ing how many ur@@ g@@ ent proble@@ ms we have to sol@@ ve in the real world . &quot;
But actually , ac@@ cor@@ ding to my res@@ ear@@ ch at the In@@ sti@@ tu@@ te for the F@@ ut@@ ure , actually the op@@ posi@@ te is tr@@ ue .
Th@@ ree b@@ illion h@@ our@@ s a we@@ e@@ k is not ne@@ ar@@ ly enough g@@ ame play to sol@@ ve the world &apos;s most ur@@ g@@ ent proble@@ ms .
In fact , I believe that if we want to sur@@ vi@@ ve the next cent@@ ur@@ y on this planet , we need to incre@@ ase that t@@ ot@@ al dra@@ ma@@ tic@@ ally .
I &apos;ve c@@ al@@ cul@@ ated the t@@ ot@@ al we need at 2@@ 1 b@@ illion h@@ our@@ s of g@@ ame play every we@@ e@@ k .
So , that &apos;s probably a bit of a co@@ unter@@ -@@ in@@ tu@@ i@@ tive idea , so I &apos;ll say it again , let it sin@@ k in : If we want to sol@@ ve proble@@ ms like h@@ ung@@ er , po@@ ver@@ ty , cli@@ ma@@ te change , glob@@ al con@@ f@@ lic@@ t , o@@ bes@@ ity , I believe that we need to as@@ p@@ ir@@ e to play g@@ am@@ es on@@ line for at le@@ ast 2@@ 1 b@@ illion h@@ our@@ s a we@@ e@@ k , by the end of the next de@@ c@@ ade .
No . I &apos;m s@@ eri@@ ous . I am .
Here &apos;s why .
This pic@@ ture pretty much su@@ ms up why I think g@@ am@@ es are so ess@@ enti@@ al to the future sur@@ vi@@ v@@ al of the human spec@@ ies . T@@ ru@@ ly .
This is a por@@ tra@@ it by ph@@ ot@@ ograp@@ her P@@ hi@@ l T@@ ol@@ e@@ dan@@ o .
He wanted to cap@@ ture the em@@ o@@ tion of g@@ am@@ ing , so he set up a c@@ am@@ er@@ a in f@@ ron@@ t of g@@ am@@ ers whi@@ le they were pla@@ ying .
And this is a cl@@ assi@@ c g@@ am@@ ing em@@ o@@ tion .
Now , if you &apos;re not a g@@ am@@ er , you might mis@@ s some of the n@@ u@@ ance in this ph@@ o@@ to .
You probably see the sense of ur@@ gen@@ cy , a little bit of fe@@ ar , but in@@ ten@@ se con@@ cent@@ ra@@ tion , de@@ ep , de@@ ep fo@@ c@@ us on t@@ ac@@ kl@@ ing a really diff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t problem .
If you are a g@@ am@@ er , you will no@@ ti@@ ce a few n@@ u@@ an@@ ces here : the c@@ r@@ in@@ k@@ le of the e@@ y@@ es up , and around the m@@ ou@@ th is a sig@@ n of op@@ tim@@ is@@ m , and the e@@ ye@@ bro@@ ws up is sur@@ pr@@ is@@ e .
This is a g@@ am@@ er who &apos;s on the ver@@ ge of something called an &quot; e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in . &quot;
Oh , you &apos;ve hear@@ d of that .
OK , good , so we have some g@@ am@@ ers am@@ ong us .
A@@ n e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in is an out@@ come that is so ex@@ tra@@ ord@@ in@@ ari@@ ly posi@@ tive , you had no idea it was even possible un@@ ti@@ l you ach@@ i@@ ev@@ ed it .
It was al@@ most be@@ y@@ on@@ d the th@@ res@@ h@@ old of ima@@ g@@ in@@ ation , and when you get there , you &apos;re sho@@ ck@@ ed to dis@@ co@@ ver what you &apos;re tru@@ ly cap@@ able of .
That &apos;s an e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in .
This is a g@@ am@@ er on the ver@@ ge of an e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in .
And this is the face that we need to see on m@@ illi@@ ons of proble@@ m@@ -@@ sol@@ ver@@ s all over the world as we try to t@@ ack@@ le the ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les of the next cent@@ ur@@ y -- the face of some@@ one who , ag@@ a@@ in@@ st all o@@ d@@ ds , is on the ver@@ ge of an e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in .
Now , un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ at@@ ely this is more of the face that we see in every@@ day life now as we try to t@@ ack@@ le ur@@ g@@ ent proble@@ ms .
This is what I call the &quot; I &apos;m N@@ ot Go@@ od A@@ t Li@@ fe &quot; face .
This is actually me making it . C@@ an you see ? Y@@ es . Go@@ od .
This is me making the &quot; I &apos;m N@@ ot Go@@ od A@@ t Li@@ fe &quot; face .
This is a piec@@ e of gra@@ ff@@ it@@ i in my old n@@ ei@@ gh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od in Ber@@ k@@ el@@ ey , C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a , where I did my Ph@@ D on why we &apos;re better in g@@ am@@ es than we are in real life .
And this is a problem that a lot of g@@ am@@ ers have .
We feel that we are not as good in re@@ ality as we are in g@@ am@@ es .
I don &apos;t mean just good as in su@@ c@@ c@@ ess@@ ful , al@@ th@@ ough that &apos;s part of it .
We do ach@@ ie@@ ve more in g@@ ame wor@@ l@@ ds .
But I also mean good as in mo@@ tiv@@ ated to do something that mat@@ ters -- in@@ spi@@ red to c@@ oll@@ ab@@ or@@ ate and to co@@ op@@ er@@ ate .
And when we &apos;re in g@@ ame wor@@ l@@ ds , I believe that many of us be@@ come the best ver@@ sion of our@@ selves -- the most li@@ k@@ ely to help at a m@@ oment &apos;s no@@ ti@@ ce , the most li@@ k@@ ely to sti@@ ck with a problem as long at it ta@@ kes , to get up after fa@@ il@@ ure and try again .
And in real life , when we face fa@@ il@@ ure , when we con@@ f@@ ron@@ t ob@@ st@@ ac@@ les , we o@@ ften don &apos;t feel that way .
We feel o@@ ver@@ come , we feel o@@ ver@@ wh@@ el@@ m@@ ed , we feel an@@ x@@ i@@ ous , maybe de@@ pres@@ s@@ ed , f@@ ru@@ str@@ ated or c@@ y@@ ni@@ cal .
We never have those fe@@ el@@ ings when we &apos;re pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es , they just don &apos;t ex@@ ist in g@@ am@@ es .
So that &apos;s what I wanted to stu@@ dy when I was a gra@@ du@@ ate stu@@ d@@ ent .
What about g@@ am@@ es ma@@ kes it im@@ possible to feel that we can &apos;t ach@@ ie@@ ve everything ?
How can we take those fe@@ el@@ ings from g@@ am@@ es and app@@ ly them to re@@ al@@ -@@ world work ?
So I loo@@ ked at g@@ am@@ es like Wor@@ ld of War@@ cra@@ ft , which is really the ide@@ al c@@ oll@@ ab@@ or@@ ative proble@@ m@@ -@@ sol@@ ving en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment .
And I started to no@@ ti@@ ce a few things that make e@@ pi@@ c w@@ ins so possible in on@@ line wor@@ l@@ ds .
The first thing is wh@@ en@@ ever you show up in one of these on@@ line g@@ am@@ es , es@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ ally in Wor@@ ld of War@@ cra@@ ft , there are l@@ ots and l@@ ots of different char@@ ac@@ ters who are wi@@ ll@@ ing to tr@@ ust you with a wor@@ l@@ d@@ -@@ sa@@ ving mis@@ sion , right away .
But not just any mis@@ sion , it &apos;s a mis@@ sion that is per@@ f@@ ec@@ tly mat@@ ch@@ ed with your cur@@ r@@ ent le@@ v@@ el in the g@@ ame .
Ri@@ ght ? So you can do it .
They never give you a ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge you can &apos;t ach@@ ie@@ ve .
But it is on the ver@@ ge of what you &apos;re cap@@ able of , so you have to try har@@ d .
But there &apos;s no un@@ em@@ p@@ lo@@ y@@ ment in Wor@@ ld of War@@ cra@@ ft ; no sit@@ ting around , w@@ r@@ ing@@ ing your hand@@ s -- there &apos;s always something spec@@ i@@ fi@@ c and important to be done .
There are also t@@ ons of c@@ oll@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ ors .
E@@ very@@ where you go , h@@ und@@ re@@ ds of thou@@ s@@ and@@ s of people ready to work with you to ach@@ ie@@ ve your e@@ pi@@ c mis@@ sion .
That &apos;s not something we have in real life that eas@@ ily , this sense that at our f@@ ing@@ er@@ ti@@ ps are t@@ ons of c@@ oll@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ ors .
And there &apos;s this e@@ pi@@ c story , this in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing story of why we &apos;re there , and what we &apos;re doing , and we get all this posi@@ tive fe@@ e@@ d@@ back .
You gu@@ ys have hear@@ d of le@@ vel@@ ing up , + 1 str@@ eng@@ th , + 1 in@@ tel@@ li@@ gen@@ ce .
We don &apos;t get that kind of con@@ st@@ ant fe@@ e@@ d@@ back in real life .
When I get off this st@@ age , I &apos;m not going to have + 1 spe@@ a@@ king , and + 1 cra@@ z@@ y idea , + 20 cra@@ z@@ y idea .
I don &apos;t get that fe@@ e@@ d@@ back in real life .
Now , the problem with c@@ oll@@ ab@@ or@@ ative on@@ line en@@ vi@@ ron@@ m@@ ents like Wor@@ ld of War@@ cra@@ ft is that it &apos;s so sa@@ ti@@ s@@ f@@ ying to be on the ver@@ ge of an e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in all the time , we de@@ ci@@ de to sp@@ end all our time in these g@@ ame wor@@ l@@ ds .
It &apos;s just better than re@@ ality .
So , so f@@ ar , col@@ lec@@ tiv@@ ely all the Wor@@ ld of War@@ cra@@ ft g@@ am@@ ers have sp@@ ent 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years sol@@ ving the vir@@ tu@@ al proble@@ ms of A@@ z@@ er@@ ot@@ h .
Now , that &apos;s not nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly a b@@ ad thing .
It might so@@ und like it &apos;s a b@@ ad thing .
But to put that in con@@ te@@ xt : 5@@ .@@ 9@@ 3 million years ago was when our ear@@ li@@ est pri@@ ma@@ te human an@@ c@@ est@@ ors sto@@ od up .
That was the first up@@ right pri@@ ma@@ te .
So when we talk about how much time we &apos;re cur@@ r@@ ent@@ ly inv@@ es@@ ting in pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es , the only way it ma@@ kes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the ma@@ g@@ n@@ it@@ u@@ de of human evol@@ ution , which is an ex@@ tra@@ ord@@ in@@ ary thing .
But it &apos;s also ap@@ t , because it tur@@ ns out that by sp@@ en@@ ding all this time pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es , we &apos;re actually chan@@ ging what we are cap@@ able of as human b@@ ein@@ gs .
We &apos;re evol@@ ving to be a more c@@ oll@@ ab@@ or@@ ative and hear@@ ty spec@@ ies .
This is tr@@ ue . I believe this .
So , con@@ si@@ der this really interesting st@@ ati@@ sti@@ c ; it was rec@@ ent@@ ly publi@@ sh@@ ed by a res@@ ear@@ cher at C@@ ar@@ ne@@ g@@ ie M@@ ell@@ on Univers@@ ity : The a@@ ver@@ age y@@ o@@ ung person today in a country with a str@@ ong g@@ am@@ er cul@@ ture will have sp@@ ent 10@@ ,000 h@@ our@@ s pla@@ ying on@@ line g@@ am@@ es by the age of 2@@ 1 .
Now 10@@ ,000 h@@ our@@ s is a really interesting number for two reas@@ ons .
F@@ ir@@ st of all , for children in the Un@@ ited St@@ ates , 10@@ ,@@ 0@@ 8@@ 0 h@@ our@@ s is the ex@@ act am@@ o@@ un@@ t of time you will sp@@ end in school , from fi@@ f@@ th gra@@ de to hi@@ gh school gra@@ du@@ ation , if you have per@@ f@@ ect at@@ ten@@ dan@@ ce .
So , we have an enti@@ re par@@ al@@ le@@ l tra@@ ck of e@@ duc@@ ation going on , where y@@ o@@ ung people are lear@@ ning as much about what it ta@@ kes to be a good g@@ am@@ er as they &apos;re lear@@ ning about everything el@@ se in school .
S@@ ome of you have probably re@@ ad M@@ al@@ col@@ m Gl@@ ad@@ well &apos;s new book &quot; O@@ ut@@ li@@ ers , &quot; so you would have hear@@ d of his the@@ ory of su@@ c@@ cess , the &quot; 10@@ ,000 h@@ our@@ s &quot; the@@ ory of su@@ c@@ cess .
It &apos;s bas@@ ed on this great c@@ og@@ ni@@ tiv@@ e-@@ sci@@ ence res@@ ear@@ ch that says if we can ma@@ ster 10@@ ,000 h@@ our@@ s of eff@@ or@@ t@@ ful stu@@ dy at anything by the age of 2@@ 1 , we will be vir@@ tu@@ os@@ os at it .
We will be as good at wh@@ at@@ ever we do as the gre@@ at@@ est people in the world .
And so , now what we &apos;re looking at is an enti@@ re gener@@ ation of y@@ o@@ ung people who are vir@@ tu@@ os@@ o g@@ am@@ ers .
So , the big question is , &quot; What ex@@ ac@@ tly are g@@ am@@ ers getting so good at ? &quot;
Because if we could fig@@ ure that out , we would have a vir@@ tually un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ent@@ ed human res@@ our@@ ce on our hand@@ s .
This is how many people we now have in the world who sp@@ end at le@@ ast an h@@ our a day pla@@ ying on@@ line g@@ am@@ es .
These are our vir@@ tu@@ os@@ o g@@ am@@ ers , 5@@ 00 million people who are ex@@ tra@@ ord@@ in@@ ari@@ ly good at something .
And in the next de@@ c@@ ade , we &apos;re going to have another b@@ illion g@@ am@@ ers who are ex@@ tra@@ ord@@ in@@ ari@@ ly good at wh@@ at@@ ever that is .
If you don &apos;t know it al@@ ready , this is coming .
The g@@ ame in@@ du@@ str@@ y is develop@@ ing con@@ sol@@ es that are lo@@ w@@ -@@ energy and that work with the wir@@ el@@ ess ph@@ one net@@ wor@@ ks in@@ ste@@ ad of bro@@ ad@@ b@@ and Internet , so that g@@ am@@ ers all over the world , partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly in Indi@@ a , Chin@@ a , B@@ ra@@ zi@@ l , can get on@@ line .
They exp@@ ect one b@@ illion more g@@ am@@ ers in the next de@@ c@@ ade .
It will br@@ ing us up to 1@@ .@@ 5 b@@ illion g@@ am@@ ers .
So I &apos;ve started to think about what these g@@ am@@ es are making us vir@@ tu@@ os@@ os at .
Here are the four things I came up with . The first is ur@@ g@@ ent op@@ tim@@ is@@ m .
OK , think of this as ex@@ tre@@ me sel@@ f@@ -@@ mo@@ tiv@@ ation .
U@@ r@@ g@@ ent op@@ tim@@ is@@ m is the des@@ ir@@ e to act im@@ medi@@ at@@ ely to t@@ ack@@ le an ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le , com@@ bin@@ ed with the belie@@ f that we have a reas@@ on@@ able hop@@ e of su@@ c@@ cess .
G@@ am@@ ers always believe that an e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in is possible , and that it &apos;s always wor@@ th trying , and trying now .
G@@ am@@ ers don &apos;t s@@ it around .
G@@ am@@ ers are vir@@ tu@@ os@@ os at we@@ a@@ ving a ti@@ ght soci@@ al f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c .
There &apos;s a lot of interesting res@@ ear@@ ch that sho@@ ws we like people better after we play a g@@ ame with them , even if they &apos;ve be@@ aten us b@@ ad@@ ly .
And the reas@@ on is , it ta@@ kes a lot of tr@@ ust to play a g@@ ame with some@@ one .
We tr@@ ust that they will sp@@ end their time with us , that they will play by the same r@@ ul@@ es , val@@ ue the same go@@ al , st@@ ay with the g@@ ame un@@ ti@@ l it &apos;s over .
And so , pla@@ ying a g@@ ame together actually buil@@ ds up b@@ on@@ ds and tr@@ ust and co@@ op@@ er@@ ation .
And we actually bu@@ ild str@@ on@@ ger soci@@ al rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ ps as a res@@ ul@@ t .
B@@ li@@ s@@ s@@ ful produc@@ tiv@@ ity . I love it .
You know , there &apos;s a reas@@ on why the a@@ ver@@ age Wor@@ ld of War@@ cra@@ ft g@@ am@@ er pla@@ ys for 2@@ 2 h@@ our@@ s a we@@ e@@ k -- kind of a hal@@ f@@ -@@ time j@@ ob .
It &apos;s because we know , when we &apos;re pla@@ ying a g@@ ame , that we &apos;re actually happ@@ ier working har@@ d than we are rel@@ a@@ x@@ ing , or h@@ an@@ ging out .
We know that we are op@@ ti@@ mi@@ zed as human b@@ ein@@ gs , to do har@@ d and me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful work .
And g@@ am@@ ers are wi@@ ll@@ ing to work har@@ d all the time , if they &apos;re gi@@ ven the right work .
F@@ in@@ ally : e@@ pi@@ c me@@ an@@ ing .
G@@ am@@ ers love to be at@@ ta@@ ch@@ ed to a@@ we@@ -@@ in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing mis@@ si@@ ons to human plan@@ et@@ ar@@ y@@ -@@ sc@@ ale stor@@ ies .
So , just one bit of tri@@ vi@@ a that hel@@ ps put that into per@@ spec@@ tive : So , you all know Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a , b@@ ig@@ ges@@ t wi@@ k@@ i in the world .
S@@ econ@@ d b@@ ig@@ ges@@ t wi@@ k@@ i in the world , with ne@@ ar@@ ly 8@@ 0@@ ,000 ar@@ tic@@ les , is the Wor@@ ld of War@@ cra@@ ft wi@@ k@@ i .
F@@ i@@ ve million people use it every mon@@ th .
They have comp@@ il@@ ed more in@@ formation about Wor@@ ld of War@@ cra@@ ft on the Internet than any other t@@ op@@ ic co@@ ver@@ ed on any other wi@@ k@@ i in the world .
They are building an e@@ pi@@ c story .
They are building an e@@ pi@@ c kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge res@@ our@@ ce about the Wor@@ ld of War@@ cra@@ ft .
Okay , so these are four su@@ per@@ po@@ wer@@ s that ad@@ d up to one thing : G@@ am@@ ers are su@@ per@@ -@@ em@@ po@@ wer@@ ed hop@@ e@@ ful in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ als .
These are people who believe that they are in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ ally cap@@ able of chan@@ ging the world .
And the only problem is , they believe that they are cap@@ able of chan@@ ging vir@@ tu@@ al wor@@ l@@ ds and not the real world .
That &apos;s the problem that I &apos;m trying to sol@@ ve .
There &apos;s an econom@@ ist nam@@ ed E@@ d@@ ward C@@ a@@ str@@ on@@ o@@ v@@ a .
H@@ is work is bri@@ lli@@ ant .
He loo@@ ks at why people are inv@@ es@@ ting so much time and energy and money in on@@ line wor@@ l@@ ds .
And he says , &quot; We &apos;re wi@@ t@@ n@@ ess@@ ing what am@@ o@@ un@@ ts to no less than a m@@ ass ex@@ o@@ d@@ us to vir@@ tu@@ al wor@@ l@@ ds and on@@ line g@@ ame en@@ vi@@ ron@@ m@@ ents . &quot;
And he &apos;s an econom@@ ist , so he &apos;s ra@@ tional .
And he says -- N@@ ot like me , I &apos;m a g@@ ame desig@@ ner ; I &apos;m ex@@ u@@ ber@@ ant .
But he says that this ma@@ kes per@@ f@@ ect sense , because g@@ am@@ ers can ach@@ ie@@ ve more in on@@ line wor@@ l@@ ds than they can in real life .
They can have str@@ on@@ ger soci@@ al rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ ps in g@@ am@@ es than they can have in real life ; they get better fe@@ e@@ d@@ back and feel more re@@ war@@ ded in g@@ am@@ es than they do in real life .
So he says , for now it ma@@ kes per@@ f@@ ect sense for g@@ am@@ ers to sp@@ end more time in vir@@ tu@@ al wor@@ l@@ ds than the real world .
Now , I also ag@@ ree that that is ra@@ tional , for now .
But it is not , by any means , an op@@ ti@@ mal sit@@ u@@ ation .
We have to start making the real world work more like a g@@ ame .
I take my in@@ spi@@ ra@@ tion from something that happened 2@@ ,@@ 5@@ 00 years ago .
These are an@@ ci@@ ent di@@ ce , made out of sh@@ e@@ ep &apos;s k@@ n@@ u@@ ck@@ les .
Be@@ fore we had a@@ w@@ es@@ ome g@@ ame con@@ tro@@ ll@@ ers , we had sh@@ e@@ ep &apos;s k@@ n@@ u@@ ck@@ les .
And these re@@ pres@@ ent the first g@@ ame e@@ qui@@ p@@ ment desig@@ ned by human b@@ ein@@ gs , and if you &apos;re fam@@ ili@@ ar with the work of the an@@ ci@@ ent G@@ re@@ e@@ k hist@@ ori@@ an Her@@ o@@ d@@ ot@@ us , you might know this hist@@ ory , which is the hist@@ ory of who inv@@ ent@@ ed g@@ am@@ es and why .
Her@@ o@@ d@@ ot@@ us says that g@@ am@@ es , partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly di@@ ce g@@ am@@ es , were inv@@ ent@@ ed in the k@@ ing@@ do@@ m of L@@ y@@ di@@ a , dur@@ ing a time of fam@@ ine .
A@@ p@@ par@@ ent@@ ly , there was such a se@@ ver@@ e fam@@ ine that the king of L@@ y@@ di@@ a de@@ ci@@ ded they had to do something cra@@ z@@ y .
P@@ e@@ ople were su@@ ff@@ er@@ ing . P@@ e@@ ople were fi@@ gh@@ ting .
It was an ex@@ tre@@ me sit@@ u@@ ation , they nee@@ ded an ex@@ tre@@ me sol@@ ution .
So , ac@@ cor@@ ding to Her@@ o@@ d@@ ot@@ us , they inv@@ ent@@ ed di@@ ce g@@ am@@ es , and they set up a k@@ ing@@ d@@ om@@ -@@ wi@@ de po@@ lic@@ y : O@@ n one day , every@@ body would e@@ at , and on the next day , every@@ body would play g@@ am@@ es .
And they would be so im@@ mer@@ s@@ ed in pla@@ ying the di@@ ce g@@ am@@ es , because g@@ am@@ es are so eng@@ ag@@ ing , and im@@ mer@@ se us in such sa@@ ti@@ s@@ f@@ ying , b@@ li@@ s@@ s@@ ful produc@@ tiv@@ ity , they would ig@@ nor@@ e the fact that they had no food to e@@ at .
And then on the next day , they would play g@@ am@@ es ; and on the next day , they would e@@ at .
And ac@@ cor@@ ding to Her@@ o@@ d@@ ot@@ us , they p@@ ass@@ ed 1@@ 8 years this way , sur@@ vi@@ ving through a fam@@ ine , by e@@ ating on one day , and pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es on the next .
Now , this is ex@@ ac@@ tly , I think , how we &apos;re using g@@ am@@ es today .
We &apos;re using g@@ am@@ es to es@@ cap@@ e re@@ al@@ -@@ world su@@ ff@@ er@@ ing -- we &apos;re using g@@ am@@ es to get away from everything that &apos;s bro@@ ken in the real en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment , everything that &apos;s not sa@@ ti@@ s@@ f@@ ying about real life , and we &apos;re getting what we need from g@@ am@@ es .
But it doesn &apos;t have to end there .
This is really ex@@ c@@ it@@ ing .
A@@ c@@ cor@@ ding to Her@@ o@@ d@@ ot@@ us , after 1@@ 8 years the fam@@ ine w@@ as@@ n &apos;t getting better , so the king de@@ ci@@ ded they would play one fin@@ al di@@ ce g@@ ame .
They di@@ vi@@ ded the enti@@ re k@@ ing@@ do@@ m in hal@@ f .
They pla@@ y@@ ed one di@@ ce g@@ ame , and the w@@ inn@@ ers of that g@@ ame got to go on an e@@ pi@@ c ad@@ v@@ ent@@ ure .
They would lea@@ ve L@@ y@@ di@@ a , and they would go out in se@@ ar@@ ch of a new place to live , lea@@ ving beh@@ ind just enough people to sur@@ vi@@ ve on the res@@ our@@ ces that were av@@ a@@ il@@ able , and hop@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly to take their ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation some@@ where el@@ se where they could th@@ ri@@ ve .
Now , this so@@ un@@ ds cra@@ z@@ y , right ?
But rec@@ ent@@ ly , D@@ N@@ A e@@ vi@@ den@@ ce has sho@@ wn that the E@@ tr@@ us@@ c@@ ans , who then l@@ ed to the R@@ om@@ an E@@ mp@@ ir@@ e , actually sh@@ are the same D@@ N@@ A as the an@@ ci@@ ent L@@ y@@ di@@ ans .
And so , rec@@ ent@@ ly , sci@@ enti@@ st@@ s have su@@ g@@ ges@@ ted that Her@@ o@@ d@@ ot@@ us &apos; cra@@ z@@ y story is actually tr@@ ue .
And ge@@ olog@@ is@@ ts have found e@@ vi@@ den@@ ce of a glob@@ al co@@ ol@@ ing that la@@ st@@ ed for ne@@ ar@@ ly 20 years , that could have ex@@ pla@@ in@@ ed the fam@@ ine .
So this cra@@ z@@ y story might be tr@@ ue .
They might have actually sa@@ ved their cul@@ ture by pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es , es@@ cap@@ ing to g@@ am@@ es for 1@@ 8 years , and then been so in@@ spi@@ red , and k@@ new so much about how to come together with g@@ am@@ es , that they actually sa@@ ved the enti@@ re ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation that way .
Okay , we can do that .
We &apos;ve been pla@@ ying War@@ cra@@ ft sin@@ ce 19@@ 9@@ 4 .
That was the first re@@ al@@ -@@ time str@@ at@@ eg@@ y g@@ ame from the Wor@@ ld of War@@ cra@@ ft s@@ eri@@ es .
That was 1@@ 6 years ago .
They pla@@ y@@ ed di@@ ce g@@ am@@ es for 1@@ 8 years , we &apos;ve been pla@@ ying War@@ cra@@ ft for 1@@ 6 years .
I say we are ready for our own e@@ pi@@ c g@@ ame .
Now , they had hal@@ f the ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation go off in se@@ ar@@ ch of a new world , so that &apos;s where I get my 2@@ 1 b@@ illion h@@ our@@ s a we@@ e@@ k of g@@ am@@ e-@@ play from .
L@@ et &apos;s get hal@@ f of us to ag@@ ree to sp@@ end an h@@ our a day pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es , un@@ ti@@ l we sol@@ ve re@@ al@@ -@@ world proble@@ ms .
Now , I know you &apos;re as@@ king , &quot; How are we going to sol@@ ve re@@ al@@ -@@ world proble@@ ms in g@@ am@@ es ? &quot;
Well , that &apos;s what I &apos;ve de@@ v@@ ot@@ ed my work to over the p@@ ast few years , at the In@@ sti@@ tu@@ te for the F@@ ut@@ ure .
We have this b@@ an@@ ner in our off@@ ic@@ es in P@@ al@@ o Al@@ to , and it ex@@ pres@@ s@@ es our vie@@ w of how we should try to rel@@ ate to the future .
We do not want to try to pre@@ dic@@ t the future .
What we want to do is make the future .
We want to ima@@ g@@ ine the best@@ -@@ c@@ ase sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o out@@ come , and then we want to em@@ power people to make that out@@ come a re@@ ality .
We want to ima@@ g@@ ine e@@ pi@@ c w@@ ins , and then give people the means to ach@@ ie@@ ve the e@@ pi@@ c w@@ in .
I &apos;m just going to very b@@ rie@@ f@@ ly show you three g@@ am@@ es that I &apos;ve made that are an att@@ em@@ pt to give people the means to create e@@ pi@@ c w@@ ins in their own fut@@ ur@@ es .
This is Wor@@ ld Wi@@ th@@ out O@@ il .
We made this g@@ ame in 200@@ 7 .
This is an on@@ line g@@ ame in which you try to sur@@ vi@@ ve an o@@ il sh@@ or@@ ta@@ ge .
The o@@ il sh@@ or@@ ta@@ ge is f@@ ic@@ tional , but we put enough on@@ line con@@ t@@ ent out there for you to believe that it &apos;s real , and to live your real life as if we &apos;ve ru@@ n out of o@@ il . So when you come to the g@@ ame , you sig@@ n up , tell us where you live , and then we give you re@@ al@@ -@@ time ne@@ ws vi@@ de@@ os , data fe@@ e@@ ds that show you ex@@ ac@@ tly how much o@@ il c@@ os@@ ts , what &apos;s not av@@ a@@ il@@ able , how food supp@@ ly is being aff@@ ec@@ ted ,
how tr@@ an@@ sp@@ or@@ ta@@ tion is being aff@@ ec@@ ted , if sch@@ o@@ ol@@ s are cl@@ os@@ ed , if there &apos;s ri@@ ot@@ ing , and you have to fig@@ ure out how you would live your real life as if this were tr@@ ue . And then we ask you to blo@@ g about it , to p@@ ost vi@@ de@@ os , to p@@ ost ph@@ ot@@ os .
We p@@ il@@ ot@@ ed this g@@ ame with 1@@ ,@@ 7@@ 00 pla@@ y@@ ers in 200@@ 7 , and we &apos;ve tra@@ ck@@ ed them for the three years sin@@ ce .
And I can tell you that this is a trans@@ forma@@ tive experi@@ ence .
N@@ o@@ body wan@@ ts to change how they live , just because it &apos;s good for the world , or because we &apos;re supp@@ os@@ ed to .
But if you im@@ mer@@ se them in an e@@ pi@@ c ad@@ v@@ ent@@ ure and tell them , &quot; We &apos;ve ru@@ n out of o@@ il .
This is an a@@ ma@@ zing story and ad@@ v@@ ent@@ ure for you to go on .
Ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge y@@ our@@ self to see how you would sur@@ vi@@ ve , &quot; most of our pla@@ y@@ ers have ke@@ pt up the hab@@ its that they lear@@ ned in this g@@ ame .
So for the next wor@@ l@@ d@@ -@@ sa@@ ving g@@ ame , we de@@ ci@@ ded to a@@ im high@@ er -- b@@ ig@@ ger problem than just pe@@ ak o@@ il .
We did a g@@ ame called Su@@ per@@ struc@@ t at the In@@ sti@@ tu@@ te for the F@@ ut@@ ure .
And the pre@@ mis@@ e was , a su@@ per@@ compu@@ ter has c@@ al@@ cul@@ ated that hum@@ ans have only 2@@ 3 years left on the planet .
This su@@ per@@ compu@@ ter was called the G@@ lob@@ al Ex@@ tin@@ c@@ tion A@@ war@@ en@@ ess Sy@@ stem , of course .
We as@@ ked people to come on@@ line -- al@@ most like a J@@ er@@ ry B@@ ru@@ ck@@ hei@@ mer mo@@ v@@ ie .
You know J@@ er@@ ry B@@ ru@@ ck@@ hei@@ mer mo@@ vi@@ es , you form a dre@@ am te@@ am -- you &apos;ve got the a@@ str@@ on@@ aut , the sci@@ enti@@ st , the ex@@ -@@ con@@ vi@@ c@@ t , and they all have something to do to sa@@ ve the world .
But in our g@@ ame , in@@ ste@@ ad of just ha@@ ving five people on the dre@@ am te@@ am , we said , &quot; E@@ very@@ body &apos;s on the dre@@ am te@@ am , and it &apos;s your j@@ ob to inv@@ ent the future of energy , the future of food , the future of heal@@ th , the future of s@@ ec@@ u@@ ri@@ ty and the future of the soci@@ al sa@@ f@@ et@@ y net . &quot;
We had 8@@ ,000 people play that g@@ ame for ei@@ ght we@@ e@@ ks .
They came up with 5@@ 00 in@@ s@@ an@@ ely cre@@ ative sol@@ u@@ tions that you can go on@@ line , Go@@ og@@ le &quot; Su@@ per@@ struc@@ t , &quot; and see .
So , fin@@ ally , the last g@@ ame , we &apos;re la@@ un@@ ch@@ ing it Mar@@ ch 3@@ r@@ d . This is a g@@ ame done with the Wor@@ ld B@@ ank In@@ sti@@ tu@@ te .
If you comp@@ le@@ te the g@@ ame , you will be cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ ed by the Wor@@ ld B@@ ank In@@ sti@@ tu@@ te as a So@@ ci@@ al In@@ nov@@ at@@ or , cl@@ ass of 20@@ 10 .
Wor@@ king with uni@@ ver@@ si@@ ties all over sub@@ -@@ S@@ ah@@ ar@@ an Africa , and we are inv@@ it@@ ing them to lear@@ n soci@@ al in@@ nov@@ ation sk@@ ill@@ s .
We &apos;ve got a gr@@ ap@@ hi@@ c nov@@ el , we &apos;ve got le@@ vel@@ ing up in sk@@ ill@@ s like lo@@ cal in@@ si@@ ght , kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge net@@ working , su@@ sta@@ in@@ abili@@ ty , v@@ isi@@ on and res@@ our@@ ce@@ f@@ ul@@ ness .
I would like to in@@ vi@@ te all of you to ple@@ ase sh@@ are this g@@ ame with y@@ o@@ ung people , any@@ where in the world , partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly in develop@@ ing are@@ as , who might ben@@ ef@@ it from coming together to try to start to ima@@ g@@ ine their own soci@@ al en@@ ter@@ pr@@ is@@ es to sa@@ ve the world .
So , I &apos;m going to w@@ ra@@ p up now .
I want to ask a question .
What do you think happ@@ ens next ?
We &apos;ve got all these a@@ ma@@ zing g@@ am@@ ers , we &apos;ve got these g@@ am@@ es that are kind of p@@ il@@ ots of what we might do , but n@@ one of them have sa@@ ved the real world y@@ et .
Well I hop@@ e you will ag@@ ree with me that g@@ am@@ ers are a human res@@ our@@ ce that we can use to do re@@ al@@ -@@ world work , that g@@ am@@ es are a po@@ wer@@ ful pl@@ at@@ form for change .
We have all these a@@ ma@@ zing su@@ per@@ po@@ wer@@ s : b@@ li@@ s@@ s@@ ful produc@@ tiv@@ ity , the abili@@ ty to we@@ a@@ ve a ti@@ ght soci@@ al f@@ ab@@ ri@@ c , this fe@@ el@@ ing of ur@@ g@@ ent op@@ tim@@ is@@ m and the des@@ ir@@ e for e@@ pi@@ c me@@ an@@ ing .
I really hop@@ e that we can come together to play g@@ am@@ es that mat@@ ter , to sur@@ vi@@ ve on this planet for another cent@@ ur@@ y .
That &apos;s my hop@@ e , that you will j@@ o@@ in me in making and pla@@ ying g@@ am@@ es like this .
When I look for@@ ward to the next de@@ c@@ ade , I know two things for s@@ ure : that we can make any future we can ima@@ g@@ ine , and we can play any g@@ am@@ es we want , so I say : L@@ et the wor@@ l@@ d@@ -@@ chan@@ ging g@@ am@@ es beg@@ in .
Thank you .
F@@ or some time I have been interes@@ ted in the plac@@ e@@ b@@ o eff@@ ect , which might se@@ em like an o@@ d@@ d thing for a ma@@ gi@@ ci@@ an to be interes@@ ted in , un@@ less you think of it in the ter@@ ms that I do , which is , &quot; S@@ om@@ e@@ thing fa@@ ke is be@@ li@@ ev@@ ed in enough by some@@ body that it be@@ comes something real . &quot;
In other wor@@ ds , su@@ g@@ ar p@@ ill@@ s have a me@@ as@@ ur@@ able eff@@ ect in cer@@ tain kin@@ ds of stu@@ dies , the plac@@ e@@ b@@ o eff@@ ect , just because the person thin@@ ks that what &apos;s happen@@ ing to them is a ph@@ ar@@ ma@@ c@@ eu@@ tical or some sort of a -- for pa@@ in man@@ a@@ ge@@ ment , for example , if they believe it enough there is a me@@ as@@ ur@@ able eff@@ ect in the body called the plac@@ e@@ b@@ o eff@@ ect .
S@@ om@@ e@@ thing fa@@ ke be@@ comes something real because of some@@ one &apos;s perc@@ ep@@ tion of it .
In or@@ der for us to understand each other , I want to start by sho@@ wing you a ru@@ di@@ ment@@ ary , very sim@@ ple ma@@ gi@@ c tri@@ ck .
And I &apos;m going to show you how it wor@@ ks . This is a tri@@ ck that &apos;s been in every children &apos;s ma@@ gi@@ c book sin@@ ce at le@@ ast the 19@@ 5@@ 0@@ s .
I lear@@ ned it my@@ self from C@@ u@@ b S@@ c@@ out Ma@@ gi@@ c in the 19@@ 7@@ 0@@ s .
I &apos;ll do it for you , and then I &apos;ll ex@@ pl@@ ain it .
And then I &apos;ll ex@@ pl@@ ain why I ex@@ pla@@ in@@ ed it .
So , here &apos;s what happ@@ ens .
The k@@ ni@@ fe , which you can exam@@ ine ; my h@@ and , which you could exam@@ ine .
I &apos;m just going to h@@ old the k@@ ni@@ fe in my f@@ ist like this .
I &apos;ll get my s@@ le@@ e@@ ve back .
And to make s@@ ure no@@ thing go@@ es up or down my s@@ le@@ e@@ ve I &apos;m just going to s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ ze my w@@ r@@ ist right here .
That way you can see that at no time can anything tra@@ v@@ el , as long as I &apos;m s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ zing there no@@ thing can go up or down my s@@ le@@ e@@ ve .
And the ob@@ ject of this is quite sim@@ ple .
I &apos;m going to op@@ en my h@@ and , and hop@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly , if all is well , my p@@ ure ani@@ mal ma@@ g@@ ne@@ ti@@ s@@ m will h@@ old the k@@ ni@@ fe .
In fact it &apos;s hel@@ d so ti@@ gh@@ tly in place that I can s@@ ha@@ ke it , and the k@@ ni@@ fe does not come off .
N@@ o@@ thing go@@ es up or down my s@@ le@@ e@@ ve , no tri@@ ck@@ er@@ y . And you can exam@@ ine everything .
Ta@@ -@@ da !
So , this is a tri@@ ck that I o@@ ften te@@ ach to y@@ o@@ ung children that are interes@@ ted in ma@@ gi@@ c , because you can lear@@ n a great de@@ al about de@@ c@@ ep@@ tion by stu@@ d@@ ying this very -- even th@@ ough it &apos;s a very sim@@ ple tri@@ ck me@@ th@@ o@@ d@@ ologi@@ c@@ ally .
Pro@@ bab@@ ly many of you in the ro@@ om know this tri@@ ck .
What happ@@ ens is this .
I h@@ old the k@@ ni@@ fe in my h@@ and .
I say I &apos;m going to gra@@ b h@@ old of my w@@ r@@ ist to make s@@ ure no@@ thing go@@ es up or down my s@@ le@@ e@@ ve , that is a l@@ ie .
The reas@@ on I &apos;m hol@@ ding on@@ to my w@@ r@@ ist is because that &apos;s actually the s@@ ec@@ re@@ t of the ill@@ usi@@ on .
In a m@@ oment when my h@@ and mo@@ ves from fac@@ ing you to being away from you , this f@@ ing@@ er right here , my in@@ de@@ x f@@ ing@@ er is just going to shi@@ ft from where it is , to a posi@@ tion po@@ in@@ ting out like this .
Ni@@ ce one .
S@@ om@@ e@@ one who didn &apos;t have a chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od is out there .
So , it go@@ es like this , from here , right .
And as I mo@@ ve around my f@@ ing@@ er shi@@ f@@ ts .
And we could talk about why this is de@@ c@@ ep@@ tive , why you don &apos;t no@@ ti@@ ce there are only three f@@ ing@@ ers down here , because the m@@ ind , and the way it pro@@ c@@ ess@@ es in@@ formation , it doesn &apos;t coun@@ t , one , two , three . It grou@@ ps them .
But that &apos;s not really what this is about . Ri@@ ght ? And then I op@@ en my h@@ and up .
Ob@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly it &apos;s cl@@ ing@@ ing there , not by ani@@ mal ma@@ g@@ ne@@ ti@@ s@@ m , but by ch@@ ic@@ an@@ er@@ y , my in@@ de@@ x f@@ ing@@ er being there .
And then when I cl@@ ose my f@@ ing@@ er , same thing , as I mo@@ ve back , this mo@@ tion kind of co@@ ver@@ s the mo@@ ving back of my f@@ ing@@ er .
I take this h@@ and away . You give the k@@ ni@@ fe out .
There is a tri@@ ck you can do for your fri@@ ends and n@@ ei@@ gh@@ b@@ ors . Th@@ an@@ ks .
Now , what does that have to do with the plac@@ e@@ b@@ o eff@@ ect ?
I re@@ ad a stu@@ dy a year or so ago that really ble@@ w my m@@ ind wi@@ de op@@ en .
I &apos;m not a do@@ c@@ tor or a res@@ ear@@ cher , so this , to me , was an ast@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing thing .
It tur@@ ns out that if you ad@@ min@@ is@@ ter a plac@@ e@@ b@@ o in the form of a whi@@ te p@@ il@@ l , that &apos;s like as@@ p@@ ir@@ in sh@@ ap@@ ed -- it &apos;s just a ro@@ und whi@@ te p@@ il@@ l -- it has some cer@@ tain me@@ as@@ ur@@ able eff@@ ect .
But if you change the form that you give the plac@@ e@@ b@@ o in , like you make a sm@@ all@@ er p@@ il@@ l , and col@@ or it b@@ lu@@ e , and st@@ am@@ p a let@@ ter into it , it is actually me@@ as@@ ur@@ ab@@ ly more eff@@ ec@@ tive .
E@@ ven th@@ ough n@@ ei@@ ther one of these things has any ph@@ ar@@ ma@@ c@@ eu@@ tical -- they &apos;re su@@ g@@ ar p@@ ill@@ s .
But a whi@@ te p@@ il@@ l is not as good as a b@@ lu@@ e p@@ il@@ l .
What ? That really f@@ li@@ pp@@ ed me out .
T@@ ur@@ ns out th@@ ough , that that &apos;s not even where it st@@ op@@ s .
If you have cap@@ s@@ ul@@ es , they &apos;re more eff@@ ec@@ tive than t@@ ab@@ le@@ ts in any form .
A col@@ or@@ ed cap@@ su@@ le , that &apos;s y@@ el@@ low on one end and red on the other is better than a whi@@ te cap@@ su@@ le .
D@@ os@@ age has something to do with this .
One p@@ il@@ l t@@ wi@@ ce a day is not as good at three p@@ ill@@ s -- I don &apos;t re@@ mem@@ ber the st@@ ati@@ sti@@ c now . S@@ or@@ ry .
But the point is ...
... these d@@ os@@ ag@@ es have something to do with it .
And the form has something to do with it .
And if you want the ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ te in plac@@ e@@ b@@ o , you &apos;ve go to the nee@@ d@@ le .
Ri@@ ght ? A sy@@ r@@ in@@ ge with some in@@ ert -- a cou@@ ple C@@ C@@ s of some in@@ ert something , and you in@@ ject this into a pa@@ ti@@ ent ...
Well this is such a po@@ wer@@ ful ima@@ ge in their m@@ ind , it &apos;s so much str@@ on@@ ger than the whi@@ te p@@ il@@ l .
It &apos;s a really , this gr@@ ap@@ h , well I &apos;ll show it to you some other time when we have s@@ li@@ des .
The point is the whi@@ te p@@ il@@ l is not as good as the b@@ lu@@ e p@@ il@@ l is not as good as the cap@@ su@@ le is not as good as the nee@@ d@@ le .
And n@@ one of it has any real ph@@ ar@@ ma@@ c@@ eu@@ tical qu@@ ality , it &apos;s only your belie@@ f that ma@@ kes it real in your body and ma@@ kes a str@@ on@@ ger eff@@ ect .
I wanted to see if I could take that idea and app@@ ly it to a ma@@ gi@@ c tri@@ ck .
And take something that is ob@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly a fa@@ ke tri@@ ck and make it se@@ em real .
And we know from that stu@@ dy that when you want re@@ ality , you go to the nee@@ d@@ le .
This is a se@@ ven@@ -@@ in@@ ch hat@@ p@@ in . It &apos;s very , very sh@@ ar@@ p , and I &apos;m going to just st@@ eri@@ li@@ ze it a tin@@ y bit .
This is really my fl@@ es@@ h . This is not D@@ am@@ i@@ an &apos;s spec@@ i@@ al@@ -@@ gro@@ wn fl@@ es@@ h .
That &apos;s my sk@@ in right there . This is not a H@@ oll@@ y@@ wo@@ od spec@@ i@@ al eff@@ ect .
I &apos;m going to pi@@ er@@ ce my sk@@ in and ru@@ n this nee@@ d@@ le through to the other side .
If you &apos;re qu@@ eas@@ y -- if you fa@@ int eas@@ ily -- I was doing this for some fri@@ ends in the h@@ ot@@ el ro@@ om last ni@@ ght , and some people that I didn &apos;t know , and one wom@@ an al@@ most p@@ ass@@ ed out .
So , I su@@ g@@ ges@@ t if you get qu@@ eas@@ y eas@@ y that you look away for about the next 30 -- in fact , you know what , I &apos;ll do the first b@@ ad part beh@@ ind it .
You &apos;ll get to see , you can look away too if you &apos;d like to .
So , here is what happ@@ ens , right here , the beg@@ inn@@ ing of my fl@@ es@@ h at the lo@@ wer part of my ar@@ m I just make a little pi@@ er@@ ce .
I &apos;m sor@@ ry , man . A@@ m I fre@@ a@@ king you out ?
OK , and then just through my sk@@ in a tin@@ y bit , and then out the other side like this .
Now , ess@@ enti@@ ally we &apos;re in the same posi@@ tion we were in with the k@@ ni@@ fe tri@@ ck .
S@@ ort of .
But you can &apos;t coun@@ t my f@@ ing@@ ers right now can you ?
So , let me show them to you . That &apos;s one , two three , four , five .
Y@@ es , well ...
I know what people think when they see this .
They go , &quot; Well , he &apos;s cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly not d@@ um@@ b enough to sta@@ b hi@@ m@@ self through the sk@@ in to en@@ ter@@ tain us for a few min@@ utes .
So , let me give you a little pe@@ e@@ k .
How &apos;s that look out there ? P@@ re@@ tty good .
Y@@ e@@ ah , I know . And the people in the back go , &quot; OK , I didn &apos;t really see that . &quot;
P@@ e@@ ople in the s@@ at@@ el@@ li@@ te ro@@ om are star@@ ting to mo@@ ve in now .
L@@ et me give you good cl@@ ose look at this .
That really is my sk@@ in . That is not a H@@ oll@@ y@@ wo@@ od spec@@ i@@ al eff@@ ect .
That &apos;s my fl@@ es@@ h , and I can t@@ w@@ ist that around .
I &apos;m sor@@ ry . If you &apos;re getting qu@@ eas@@ y , look away , don &apos;t look at the thing .
P@@ e@@ ople in the back or people on vi@@ de@@ o years from now wat@@ ch@@ ing this will go , &quot; Well ye@@ ah , that loo@@ ks kind of ne@@ at in some sort of eff@@ ect there , but if it were real he would be -- see there &apos;s a h@@ ole there and a h@@ ole there , if it were real he would be ble@@ e@@ ding .
Well let me work up some blo@@ od for you .
Y@@ es , there it is .
N@@ or@@ m@@ ally now , I would take the nee@@ d@@ le out .
I would cle@@ an off my ar@@ m , and I would show you that there are no wo@@ un@@ ds .
But I think in this con@@ te@@ xt and with the idea of ta@@ king something fa@@ ke and making it into something real , I &apos;m just going to lea@@ ve it there , and w@@ alk off the st@@ age .
I will be se@@ eing you se@@ ver@@ al times over the next few da@@ ys .
I hop@@ e you &apos;re looking for@@ ward to that . Thank you very much .
So , I &apos;ve kno@@ wn a lot of f@@ ish in my life .
I &apos;ve lo@@ ved only two .
That first one , it was more like a passi@@ on@@ ate aff@@ a@@ ir .
It was a beau@@ ti@@ ful f@@ ish : f@@ la@@ vor@@ ful , te@@ x@@ tu@@ red , me@@ at@@ y , a bes@@ ts@@ ell@@ er on the men@@ u .
What a f@@ ish .
E@@ ven better , it was f@@ ar@@ m@@ -@@ ra@@ is@@ ed to the supp@@ os@@ ed high@@ est stand@@ ar@@ ds of su@@ sta@@ in@@ abili@@ ty .
So you could feel good about s@@ ell@@ ing it .
I was in a rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p with this beau@@ ty for se@@ ver@@ al mon@@ ths .
One day , the he@@ ad of the comp@@ any called and as@@ ked if I &apos;d spe@@ ak at an ev@@ ent about the f@@ ar@@ m &apos;s su@@ sta@@ in@@ abili@@ ty .
&quot; Ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely , &quot; I said .
Here was a comp@@ any trying to sol@@ ve what &apos;s be@@ come this uni@@ ma@@ g@@ in@@ able problem for us ch@@ ef@@ s : How do we ke@@ ep f@@ ish on our men@@ us ?
F@@ or the p@@ ast 50 years , we &apos;ve been f@@ is@@ h@@ ing the se@@ as like we c@@ lear@@ -@@ c@@ ut for@@ es@@ ts .
It &apos;s har@@ d to o@@ verst@@ ate the des@@ tru@@ c@@ tion .
N@@ in@@ et@@ y percent of lar@@ ge f@@ ish , the ones we love -- the t@@ un@@ as , the hal@@ i@@ bu@@ ts , the s@@ al@@ mon@@ s , s@@ wor@@ d@@ f@@ ish -- they &apos;ve c@@ oll@@ ap@@ s@@ ed .
There &apos;s al@@ most no@@ thing left .
So , for better or for wor@@ se , a@@ qu@@ ac@@ ul@@ ture , f@@ ish f@@ ar@@ m@@ ing , is going to be a part of our future .
A lot of ar@@ g@@ um@@ ents ag@@ a@@ in@@ st it : F@@ ish f@@ ar@@ ms p@@ oll@@ ute -- most of them do any@@ way -- and they &apos;re in@@ eff@@ ic@@ i@@ ent . Ta@@ ke t@@ un@@ a , a ma@@ j@@ or dra@@ w@@ back .
It &apos;s got a fe@@ ed con@@ ver@@ sion ra@@ ti@@ o of 15 to one .
That means it ta@@ kes fi@@ f@@ te@@ en po@@ un@@ ds of wi@@ ld f@@ ish to get you one po@@ und of f@@ ar@@ m t@@ un@@ a .
N@@ ot very su@@ sta@@ in@@ able .
It doesn &apos;t ta@@ ste very good ei@@ ther .
So here , fin@@ ally , was a comp@@ any trying to do it right .
I wanted to supp@@ ort them .
The day before the ev@@ ent , I called the he@@ ad of P@@ .@@ R@@ . for the comp@@ any .
L@@ et &apos;s call him D@@ on .
&quot; D@@ on , &quot; I said , &quot; just to get the fac@@ ts stra@@ i@@ ght , you gu@@ ys are fam@@ ous for f@@ ar@@ m@@ ing so f@@ ar out to se@@ a , you don &apos;t p@@ oll@@ ute . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s right , &quot; he said . &quot; We &apos;re so f@@ ar out , the wa@@ ste from our f@@ ish ge@@ ts dis@@ tri@@ b@@ ut@@ ed , not con@@ cent@@ r@@ ated . &quot;
And then he ad@@ ded , &quot; We &apos;re bas@@ ically a world un@@ to our@@ selves .
That fe@@ ed con@@ ver@@ sion ra@@ ti@@ o ? 2@@ .@@ 5 to one , &quot; he said .
&quot; B@@ est in the bus@@ iness . &quot;
2@@ .@@ 5 to one , great .
&quot; 2@@ .@@ 5 what ? What are you fe@@ e@@ ding ? &quot;
&quot; Su@@ sta@@ in@@ able pr@@ ot@@ ein@@ s , &quot; he said .
&quot; G@@ re@@ at , &quot; I said . G@@ ot off the ph@@ one .
And that ni@@ ght , I was l@@ ying in b@@ ed , and I thought : What the h@@ ell is a su@@ sta@@ in@@ able pr@@ ot@@ ein ?
So the next day , just before the ev@@ ent , I called D@@ on .
I said , &quot; D@@ on , what are some exam@@ pl@@ es of su@@ sta@@ in@@ able pr@@ ot@@ ein@@ s ? &quot;
He said he didn &apos;t know . He would ask around .
Well , I got on the ph@@ one with a few people in the comp@@ any ; no one could give me a stra@@ i@@ ght ans@@ wer un@@ ti@@ l fin@@ ally , I got on the ph@@ one with the he@@ ad bi@@ olog@@ ist .
L@@ et &apos;s call him D@@ on too .
&quot; D@@ on , &quot; I said , &quot; what are some exam@@ pl@@ es of su@@ sta@@ in@@ able pr@@ ot@@ ein@@ s ? &quot;
Well , he men@@ tion@@ ed some al@@ ga@@ es and some f@@ ish me@@ als , and then he said chi@@ cken p@@ el@@ le@@ ts .
I said , &quot; C@@ hi@@ cken p@@ el@@ le@@ ts ? &quot;
He said , &quot; Y@@ e@@ ah , fe@@ a@@ th@@ ers , sk@@ in , b@@ one me@@ al , sc@@ rap@@ s , dri@@ ed and pro@@ c@@ ess@@ ed into fe@@ ed . &quot;
I said , &quot; What perc@@ ent@@ age of your fe@@ ed is chi@@ cken ? &quot;
Th@@ in@@ king , you know , two percent .
&quot; Well , it &apos;s about 30 percent , &quot; he said .
I said , &quot; D@@ on , what &apos;s su@@ sta@@ in@@ able about fe@@ e@@ ding chi@@ cken to f@@ ish ? &quot;
There was a long p@@ ause on the line , and he said , &quot; There &apos;s just too much chi@@ cken in the world . &quot;
I f@@ ell out of love with this f@@ ish .
No , not because I &apos;m some sel@@ f@@ -@@ ri@@ gh@@ te@@ ous , go@@ o@@ d@@ y@@ -@@ two sho@@ es fo@@ o@@ die .
I actually am .
No , I actually f@@ ell out of love with this f@@ ish because , I s@@ we@@ ar to G@@ od , after that con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion , the f@@ ish ta@@ st@@ ed like chi@@ cken .
This second f@@ ish , it &apos;s a different kind of love story .
It &apos;s the ro@@ man@@ tic kind , the kind where the more you get to know your f@@ ish , you love the f@@ ish .
I first ate it at a res@@ t@@ au@@ r@@ ant in s@@ ou@@ th@@ ern S@@ pa@@ in .
A j@@ our@@ n@@ al@@ ist fri@@ end had been talking about this f@@ ish for a long time .
S@@ he kind of set us up .
It came to the t@@ able a b@@ right , al@@ most shi@@ mm@@ er@@ ing , whi@@ te col@@ or .
The ch@@ e@@ f had o@@ ver@@ co@@ o@@ ked it .
Li@@ ke t@@ wi@@ ce over .
A@@ ma@@ z@@ ing@@ ly , it was still de@@ li@@ ci@@ ous .
Wh@@ o can make a f@@ ish ta@@ ste good after it &apos;s been o@@ ver@@ co@@ o@@ ked ?
I can &apos;t , but this gu@@ y can .
L@@ et &apos;s call him M@@ ig@@ u@@ el -- actually his n@@ ame is M@@ ig@@ u@@ el .
And no , he didn &apos;t co@@ ok the f@@ ish , and he &apos;s not a ch@@ e@@ f , at le@@ ast in the way that you and I understand it .
He &apos;s a bi@@ olog@@ ist at V@@ et@@ a L@@ a P@@ al@@ ma .
It &apos;s a f@@ ish f@@ ar@@ m in the s@@ ou@@ th@@ w@@ es@@ tern cor@@ ner of S@@ pa@@ in .
It &apos;s at the ti@@ p of the G@@ u@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r ri@@ ver .
Un@@ ti@@ l the 19@@ 8@@ 0@@ s , the f@@ ar@@ m was in the hand@@ s of the Ar@@ gent@@ ini@@ ans .
They ra@@ is@@ ed be@@ e@@ f c@@ att@@ le on what was ess@@ enti@@ ally w@@ et@@ l@@ and@@ s .
They did it by dra@@ in@@ ing the land .
They buil@@ t this in@@ tri@@ c@@ ate s@@ eri@@ es of can@@ als , and they p@@ us@@ h@@ ed water off the land and out into the ri@@ ver .
Well , they cou@@ ldn &apos;t make it work , not econom@@ ically .
And ec@@ ologi@@ c@@ ally , it was a dis@@ a@@ ster .
It k@@ ill@@ ed like 9@@ 0 percent of the b@@ ir@@ ds , which , for this place , is a lot of b@@ ir@@ ds .
And so in 19@@ 8@@ 2 , a Sp@@ an@@ ish comp@@ any with an en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment@@ al con@@ sci@@ ence p@@ ur@@ ch@@ as@@ ed the land .
What did they do ?
They re@@ vers@@ ed the f@@ low of water .
They li@@ ter@@ ally f@@ li@@ pp@@ ed the s@@ wi@@ t@@ ch .
In@@ ste@@ ad of p@@ us@@ h@@ ing water out , they used the chan@@ n@@ els to p@@ ul@@ l water back in .
They f@@ loo@@ ded the can@@ als .
They cre@@ ated a 2@@ 7@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ ac@@ re f@@ ish f@@ ar@@ m -- b@@ ass , m@@ ul@@ let , sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p , e@@ el -- and in the pro@@ cess , M@@ ig@@ u@@ el and this comp@@ any comp@@ let@@ ely re@@ vers@@ ed the ec@@ ologi@@ cal des@@ tru@@ c@@ tion .
The f@@ ar@@ m &apos;s incre@@ di@@ ble .
I mean , you &apos;ve never se@@ en anything like this .
You st@@ are out at a h@@ ori@@ z@@ on that is a million m@@ il@@ es away , and all you see are f@@ loo@@ ded can@@ als and this th@@ ic@@ k , r@@ ich mar@@ sh@@ land .
I was there not long ago with M@@ ig@@ u@@ el .
He &apos;s an a@@ ma@@ zing gu@@ y , like three par@@ ts C@@ har@@ les D@@ ar@@ w@@ in and one part C@@ ro@@ co@@ di@@ le D@@ un@@ de@@ e .
Okay ? There we are s@@ lo@@ g@@ ging through the w@@ et@@ l@@ and@@ s , and I &apos;m p@@ an@@ ting and s@@ we@@ ating , got m@@ u@@ d up to my k@@ ne@@ es , and M@@ ig@@ u@@ el &apos;s c@@ al@@ m@@ ly con@@ duc@@ ting a bi@@ olog@@ y lec@@ ture .
Here , he &apos;s po@@ in@@ ting out a r@@ are B@@ l@@ ack@@ -@@ sh@@ ou@@ l@@ der@@ ed K@@ i@@ te .
Now , he &apos;s men@@ tion@@ ing the min@@ er@@ al nee@@ ds of ph@@ y@@ t@@ op@@ lan@@ k@@ ton .
And here , here he se@@ es a grou@@ p@@ ing pat@@ tern that re@@ min@@ ds him of the T@@ an@@ z@@ ani@@ an G@@ i@@ ra@@ ff@@ e .
It tur@@ ns out , M@@ ig@@ u@@ el sp@@ ent the better part of his car@@ e@@ er in the Mi@@ k@@ um@@ i N@@ ational Par@@ k in Africa .
I as@@ ked him how he bec@@ ame such an exper@@ t on f@@ ish .
He said , &quot; F@@ ish ? I didn &apos;t know anything about f@@ ish .
I &apos;m an exper@@ t in rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ ps . &quot;
And then he &apos;s off , la@@ un@@ ch@@ ing into more talk about r@@ are b@@ ir@@ ds and al@@ ga@@ es and st@@ ran@@ ge a@@ qu@@ ati@@ c plan@@ ts .
And don &apos;t get me w@@ r@@ ong , that was really fas@@ c@@ in@@ ating , you know , the bi@@ o@@ tic comm@@ unity un@@ pl@@ u@@ g@@ g@@ ed , kind of thing .
It &apos;s great , but I was in love .
And my he@@ ad was s@@ wo@@ on@@ ing over that o@@ ver@@ co@@ o@@ ked piec@@ e of de@@ li@@ ci@@ ous f@@ ish I had the ni@@ ght before .
So I inter@@ ru@@ p@@ ted him . I said , &quot; M@@ ig@@ u@@ el , what ma@@ kes your f@@ ish ta@@ ste so good ? &quot;
He po@@ in@@ ted at the al@@ ga@@ e .
&quot; I know , du@@ de , the al@@ ga@@ e , the ph@@ y@@ t@@ op@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ ps : It &apos;s a@@ ma@@ zing .
But what are your f@@ ish e@@ ating ?
What &apos;s the fe@@ ed con@@ ver@@ sion ra@@ ti@@ o ? &quot;
Well , he go@@ es on to tell me it &apos;s such a r@@ ich system that the f@@ ish are e@@ ating what they &apos;d be e@@ ating in the wi@@ ld .
The pl@@ ant bi@@ om@@ ass , the ph@@ y@@ t@@ op@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , the z@@ o@@ op@@ lan@@ k@@ ton , it &apos;s what fe@@ e@@ ds the f@@ ish .
The system is so heal@@ th@@ y , it &apos;s t@@ ot@@ ally sel@@ f@@ -@@ r@@ en@@ e@@ wing .
There is no fe@@ ed .
E@@ ver hear@@ d of a f@@ ar@@ m that doesn &apos;t fe@@ ed its an@@ im@@ als ?
L@@ ater that day , I was dri@@ ving around this pro@@ per@@ ty with M@@ ig@@ u@@ el , and I as@@ ked him , I said , &quot; F@@ or a place that se@@ em@@ s so nat@@ ur@@ al , un@@ like like any f@@ ar@@ m I &apos;d ever been at , how do you me@@ as@@ ure su@@ c@@ cess ? &quot;
A@@ t that m@@ oment , it was as if a fil@@ m di@@ rec@@ tor called for a set change .
And we ro@@ und@@ ed the cor@@ ner and sa@@ w the most a@@ ma@@ zing si@@ ght : thou@@ s@@ and@@ s and thou@@ s@@ and@@ s of p@@ in@@ k fl@@ am@@ in@@ go@@ s , a li@@ ter@@ al p@@ in@@ k car@@ pe@@ t for as f@@ ar as you could see .
&quot; That &apos;s su@@ c@@ cess , &quot; he said .
&quot; L@@ oo@@ k at their bel@@ li@@ es , p@@ in@@ k .
They &apos;re fe@@ ast@@ ing . &quot;
F@@ e@@ ast@@ ing ? I was t@@ ot@@ ally con@@ f@@ used .
I said , &quot; M@@ ig@@ u@@ el , ar@@ en &apos;t they fe@@ ast@@ ing on your f@@ ish ? &quot;
&quot; Y@@ es , &quot; he said .
&quot; We l@@ ose 20 percent of our f@@ ish and f@@ ish eg@@ gs to b@@ ir@@ ds .
Well , last year , this pro@@ per@@ ty had 6@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,000 b@@ ir@@ ds on it , more than 2@@ 50 different spec@@ ies .
It &apos;s be@@ come , today , the lar@@ ges@@ t and one of the most important pri@@ v@@ ate b@@ ir@@ d s@@ an@@ c@@ tu@@ ar@@ ies in all of E@@ u@@ rop@@ e . &quot;
I said , &quot; M@@ ig@@ u@@ el , is@@ n &apos;t a th@@ ri@@ ving b@@ ir@@ d p@@ op@@ ul@@ ation like the last thing you want on a f@@ ish f@@ ar@@ m ? &quot;
He sh@@ oo@@ k his he@@ ad , no .
He said , &quot; We f@@ ar@@ m ex@@ ten@@ si@@ v@@ ely , not in@@ ten@@ si@@ v@@ ely .
This is an ec@@ ologi@@ cal net@@ work .
The fl@@ am@@ in@@ go@@ s e@@ at the sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p .
The sh@@ ri@@ m@@ p e@@ at the ph@@ y@@ t@@ op@@ lan@@ k@@ ton .
So the p@@ in@@ ker the bel@@ ly , the better the system . &quot;
Okay , so let &apos;s re@@ vie@@ w : a f@@ ar@@ m that doesn &apos;t fe@@ ed its an@@ im@@ als , and a f@@ ar@@ m that me@@ as@@ ur@@ es its su@@ c@@ cess on the heal@@ th of its pre@@ dat@@ ors .
A f@@ ish f@@ ar@@ m , but also a b@@ ir@@ d s@@ an@@ c@@ tu@@ ary .
Oh , and by the way , those fl@@ am@@ in@@ go@@ s , they sh@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t even be there in the first place .
They bro@@ od in a to@@ wn 1@@ 50 m@@ il@@ es away , where the so@@ il con@@ di@@ tions are better for building n@@ es@@ ts .
E@@ very mor@@ ning , they f@@ ly 1@@ 50 m@@ il@@ es into the f@@ ar@@ m .
And every ev@@ en@@ ing , they f@@ ly 1@@ 50 m@@ il@@ es back .
They do that because they &apos;re able to fol@@ low the bro@@ ken whi@@ te line of high@@ way A@@ 9@@ 2 .
No ki@@ d@@ ding .
I was ima@@ g@@ in@@ ing a &quot; Mar@@ ch of the P@@ en@@ gu@@ ins &quot; thing , so I loo@@ ked at M@@ ig@@ u@@ el .
I said , &quot; M@@ ig@@ u@@ el , do they f@@ ly 1@@ 50 m@@ il@@ es to the f@@ ar@@ m , and then do they f@@ ly 1@@ 50 m@@ il@@ es back at ni@@ ght ?
D@@ o they do that for the children ? &quot;
He loo@@ ked at me like I had just quot@@ ed a Wh@@ it@@ ne@@ y H@@ ou@@ st@@ on s@@ ong .
He said , &quot; No ; they do it because the food &apos;s better . &quot;
I didn &apos;t men@@ tion the sk@@ in of my bel@@ o@@ ved f@@ ish , which was de@@ li@@ ci@@ ous -- and I don &apos;t like f@@ ish sk@@ in ; I don &apos;t like it se@@ ar@@ ed , I don &apos;t like it c@@ ris@@ p@@ y .
It &apos;s that ac@@ ri@@ d , t@@ ar@@ -@@ like f@@ la@@ vor .
I al@@ most never co@@ ok with it .
Y@@ et , when I ta@@ st@@ ed it at that res@@ t@@ au@@ r@@ ant in s@@ ou@@ th@@ ern S@@ pa@@ in , it ta@@ st@@ ed not at all like f@@ ish sk@@ in .
It ta@@ st@@ ed s@@ we@@ et and cle@@ an , like you were ta@@ king a bi@@ te of the o@@ ce@@ an .
I men@@ tion@@ ed that to M@@ ig@@ u@@ el , and he no@@ d@@ ded .
He said , &quot; The sk@@ in ac@@ ts like a sp@@ on@@ ge .
It &apos;s the last de@@ f@@ en@@ se before anything en@@ ters the body .
It evol@@ ved to so@@ ak up im@@ pu@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
And then he ad@@ ded , &quot; But our water has no im@@ pu@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
OK . A f@@ ar@@ m that doesn &apos;t fe@@ ed its f@@ ish , a f@@ ar@@ m that me@@ as@@ ur@@ es its su@@ c@@ cess by the su@@ c@@ cess of its pre@@ dat@@ ors .
And then I re@@ ali@@ zed when he says , &quot; A f@@ ar@@ m that has no im@@ pu@@ ri@@ ties , &quot; he made a big under@@ stat@@ em@@ ent , because the water that flo@@ ws through that f@@ ar@@ m comes in from the G@@ u@@ ad@@ al@@ qui@@ vi@@ r Ri@@ ver .
It &apos;s a ri@@ ver that car@@ ri@@ es with it all the things that ri@@ ver@@ s t@@ end to car@@ ry these da@@ ys : ch@@ em@@ ic@@ al con@@ t@@ am@@ in@@ an@@ ts , p@@ es@@ ti@@ ci@@ de r@@ un@@ off .
And when it wor@@ ks its way through the system and lea@@ ves , the water is cle@@ an@@ er than when it en@@ ter@@ ed .
The system is so heal@@ th@@ y , it pu@@ ri@@ fi@@ es the water .
So , not just a f@@ ar@@ m that doesn &apos;t fe@@ ed its an@@ im@@ als , not just a f@@ ar@@ m that me@@ as@@ ur@@ es its su@@ c@@ cess by the heal@@ th of its pre@@ dat@@ ors , but a f@@ ar@@ m that &apos;s li@@ ter@@ ally a water pu@@ ri@@ f@@ ic@@ ation pl@@ ant -- and not just for those f@@ ish , but for you and me as well .
Because when that water lea@@ ves , it d@@ um@@ ps out into the At@@ lan@@ tic .
A dro@@ p in the o@@ ce@@ an , I know , but I &apos;ll take it , and so should you , because this love story , ho@@ we@@ ver ro@@ man@@ tic , is also in@@ struc@@ tive .
You might say it &apos;s a re@@ ci@@ p@@ e for the future of good food , wh@@ e@@ ther we &apos;re talking about b@@ ass or be@@ e@@ f c@@ att@@ le .
What we need now is a ra@@ dic@@ ally new con@@ c@@ ep@@ tion of ag@@ ri@@ cul@@ ture , one in which the food actually ta@@ st@@ es good .
But for a lot people , that &apos;s a bit too ra@@ di@@ cal .
We &apos;re not re@@ alis@@ ts , us fo@@ o@@ dies ; we &apos;re lo@@ ver@@ s .
We love f@@ ar@@ m@@ ers &apos; mark@@ ets , we love small fam@@ ily f@@ ar@@ ms , we talk about lo@@ cal food , we e@@ at organ@@ ic .
And when you su@@ g@@ ges@@ t these are the things that will en@@ s@@ ure the future of good food , some@@ one , some@@ where stand@@ s up and says , &quot; H@@ ey gu@@ y , I love p@@ in@@ k fl@@ am@@ in@@ go@@ s , but how are you going to fe@@ ed the world ? &quot;
How are you going to fe@@ ed the world ?
C@@ an I be h@@ on@@ est ?
I don &apos;t love that question .
No , not because we al@@ ready produ@@ ce enough c@@ al@@ or@@ ies to more than fe@@ ed the world .
One b@@ illion people will go h@@ un@@ gr@@ y today .
One b@@ illion -- that &apos;s more than ever before -- because of gr@@ os@@ s in@@ e@@ qu@@ ali@@ ties in dis@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion , not t@@ on@@ n@@ age .
Now , I don &apos;t love this question because it &apos;s de@@ ter@@ min@@ ed the lo@@ gi@@ c of our food system for the last 50 years .
F@@ e@@ ed gra@@ in to her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , p@@ es@@ ti@@ ci@@ des to mon@@ o@@ cul@@ tur@@ es , ch@@ em@@ ic@@ als to so@@ il , chi@@ cken to f@@ ish , and all al@@ ong ag@@ ri@@ bus@@ iness has sim@@ p@@ ly as@@ ked , &quot; If we &apos;re fe@@ e@@ ding more people more ch@@ e@@ ap@@ ly , how ter@@ ri@@ ble could that be ? &quot;
That &apos;s been the mo@@ tiv@@ ation , it &apos;s been the j@@ us@@ ti@@ f@@ ic@@ ation : it &apos;s been the bus@@ iness pl@@ an of Ameri@@ can ag@@ ri@@ cul@@ ture .
We should call it what it is : a bus@@ iness in li@@ qui@@ da@@ tion , a bus@@ iness that &apos;s qui@@ ck@@ ly er@@ o@@ ding ec@@ ologi@@ cal cap@@ ital that ma@@ kes that very produc@@ tion possible .
That &apos;s not a bus@@ iness , and it is@@ n &apos;t ag@@ ri@@ cul@@ ture .
O@@ ur bre@@ ad@@ bas@@ k@@ et is th@@ re@@ at@@ en@@ ed today , not because of di@@ min@@ is@@ h@@ ing supp@@ ly , but because of di@@ min@@ is@@ h@@ ing res@@ our@@ ces .
N@@ ot by the l@@ at@@ est com@@ b@@ ine and tra@@ c@@ tor inv@@ en@@ tion , but by fer@@ ti@@ le land ; not by p@@ um@@ ps , but by f@@ res@@ h water ; not by ch@@ a@@ in@@ sa@@ ws , but by for@@ es@@ ts ; and not by f@@ is@@ h@@ ing bo@@ at@@ s and n@@ ets , but by f@@ ish in the se@@ a .
W@@ ant to fe@@ ed the world ?
L@@ et &apos;s start by as@@ king : How are we going to fe@@ ed our@@ selves ?
O@@ r better : How can we create con@@ di@@ tions that en@@ able every comm@@ unity to fe@@ ed it@@ self ?
T@@ o do that , don &apos;t look at the ag@@ ri@@ bus@@ iness mo@@ del for the future .
It &apos;s really old , and it &apos;s ti@@ red .
It &apos;s hi@@ gh on cap@@ ital , ch@@ em@@ is@@ try and ma@@ ch@@ in@@ es , and it &apos;s never produc@@ ed anything really good to e@@ at .
In@@ ste@@ ad , let &apos;s look to the ec@@ ologi@@ cal mo@@ del .
That &apos;s the one that re@@ li@@ es on two b@@ illion years of on@@ -@@ the@@ -@@ j@@ ob experi@@ ence .
L@@ oo@@ k to M@@ ig@@ u@@ el , f@@ ar@@ m@@ ers like M@@ ig@@ u@@ el .
F@@ ar@@ ms that ar@@ en &apos;t wor@@ l@@ ds un@@ to the@@ m@@ selves ; f@@ ar@@ ms that res@@ t@@ ore in@@ ste@@ ad of de@@ ple@@ te ; f@@ ar@@ ms that f@@ ar@@ m ex@@ ten@@ si@@ v@@ ely in@@ ste@@ ad of just in@@ ten@@ si@@ v@@ ely ; f@@ ar@@ m@@ ers that are not just produc@@ ers , but exper@@ ts in rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ ps .
Because they &apos;re the ones that are exper@@ ts in f@@ la@@ vor , too .
And if I &apos;m going to be really h@@ on@@ est , they &apos;re a better ch@@ e@@ f than I &apos;ll ever be .
You know , I &apos;m ok@@ ay with that , because if that &apos;s the future of good food , it &apos;s going to be de@@ li@@ ci@@ ous .
Thank you .
I gre@@ w up on a ste@@ ad@@ y di@@ et of sci@@ ence f@@ ic@@ tion .
In hi@@ gh school , I took a b@@ us to school an h@@ our each way every day .
And I was always ab@@ sor@@ b@@ ed in a book , sci@@ ence f@@ ic@@ tion book , which took my m@@ ind to other wor@@ l@@ ds , and sa@@ ti@@ s@@ fi@@ ed , in a n@@ ar@@ ra@@ tive form , this in@@ sa@@ ti@@ able sense of c@@ u@@ ri@@ os@@ ity that I had .
And you know , that c@@ u@@ ri@@ os@@ ity also man@@ i@@ f@@ es@@ ted it@@ self in the fact that wh@@ en@@ ever I w@@ as@@ n &apos;t in school I was out in the w@@ oo@@ ds , hi@@ king and ta@@ king &quot; sam@@ pl@@ es &quot; -- f@@ ro@@ gs and s@@ n@@ ak@@ es and bu@@ gs and pon@@ d water -- and br@@ ing@@ ing it back , looking at it un@@ der the m@@ ic@@ ros@@ c@@ op@@ e .
You know , I was a real sci@@ ence ge@@ e@@ k .
But it was all about trying to understand the world , understand the li@@ mit@@ s of possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ty .
And my love of sci@@ ence f@@ ic@@ tion actually se@@ em@@ ed m@@ ir@@ r@@ or@@ ed in the world around me , because what was happen@@ ing , this was in the l@@ ate &apos; 6@@ 0@@ s , we were going to the mo@@ on , we were ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ing the de@@ ep o@@ ce@@ ans .
J@@ ac@@ qu@@ es C@@ ou@@ ste@@ au was coming into our li@@ ving ro@@ om@@ s with his a@@ ma@@ zing spec@@ i@@ als that sho@@ w@@ ed us an@@ im@@ als and plac@@ es and a w@@ on@@ dr@@ ous world that we could never really have pre@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly ima@@ g@@ in@@ ed .
So , that se@@ em@@ ed to res@@ on@@ ate with the whole sci@@ ence f@@ ic@@ tion part of it .
And I was an arti@@ st .
I could dra@@ w . I could pa@@ int .
And I found that because there wer@@ en &apos;t vi@@ de@@ o g@@ am@@ es and this s@@ at@@ ur@@ ation of C@@ G mo@@ vi@@ es and all of this ima@@ ger@@ y in the medi@@ a l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e , I had to create these ima@@ ges in my he@@ ad .
You know , we all did , as kids ha@@ ving to re@@ ad a book , and through the au@@ th@@ or &apos;s des@@ cri@@ p@@ tion , put something on the mo@@ v@@ ie s@@ cre@@ en in our he@@ a@@ ds .
And so , my res@@ pon@@ se to this was to pa@@ int , to dra@@ w ali@@ en cre@@ at@@ ur@@ es , ali@@ en wor@@ l@@ ds , ro@@ bot@@ s , sp@@ ac@@ es@@ hi@@ ps , all that stuff .
I was end@@ l@@ ess@@ ly getting bu@@ st@@ ed in mat@@ h cl@@ ass do@@ o@@ d@@ l@@ ing beh@@ ind the te@@ x@@ t@@ book .
That was -- the cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity had to find its out@@ let som@@ eh@@ ow .
And an interesting thing happened : The J@@ ac@@ qu@@ es C@@ ou@@ ste@@ au sho@@ ws actually got me very ex@@ c@@ ited about the fact that there was an ali@@ en world right here on Earth .
I might not really go to an ali@@ en world on a sp@@ ac@@ es@@ hi@@ p some@@ day -- that se@@ em@@ ed pretty dar@@ n un@@ li@@ k@@ ely .
But that was a world I could really go to , right here on Earth , that was as r@@ ich and ex@@ o@@ tic as anything that I had ima@@ g@@ in@@ ed from read@@ ing these bo@@ o@@ ks .
So , I de@@ ci@@ ded I was going to be@@ come a sc@@ ub@@ a di@@ ver at the age of 15 .
And the only problem with that was that I li@@ ved in a little v@@ il@@ la@@ ge in C@@ an@@ ad@@ a , 6@@ 00 m@@ il@@ es from the ne@@ ar@@ est o@@ ce@@ an .
But I didn &apos;t let that da@@ un@@ t me .
I p@@ es@@ ter@@ ed my fa@@ ther un@@ ti@@ l he fin@@ ally found a sc@@ ub@@ a cl@@ ass in Bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , New York , right ac@@ ross the bor@@ der from where we live .
And I actually got cer@@ ti@@ fi@@ ed in a po@@ ol at a Y@@ M@@ C@@ A in the de@@ ad of win@@ ter in Bu@@ ff@@ al@@ o , New York .
And I didn &apos;t see the o@@ ce@@ an , a real o@@ ce@@ an , for another two years , un@@ ti@@ l we mo@@ ved to C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a .
S@@ in@@ ce then , in the inter@@ ven@@ ing 4@@ 0 years , I &apos;ve sp@@ ent about 3@@ ,000 h@@ our@@ s under@@ water , and 5@@ 00 h@@ our@@ s of that was in sub@@ mer@@ si@@ b@@ les .
And I &apos;ve lear@@ ned that that de@@ ep@@ -@@ o@@ ce@@ an en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment , and even the sh@@ al@@ low o@@ ce@@ ans , are so r@@ ich with a@@ ma@@ zing life that really is be@@ y@@ on@@ d our ima@@ g@@ in@@ ation .
Nat@@ ure &apos;s ima@@ g@@ in@@ ation is so bo@@ und@@ less com@@ par@@ ed to our own me@@ ag@@ er human ima@@ g@@ in@@ ation .
I still , to this day , stand in ab@@ sol@@ ute a@@ we of what I see when I make these di@@ ves .
And my love aff@@ a@@ ir with the o@@ ce@@ an is on@@ going , and just as str@@ ong as it ever was .
But when I ch@@ ose a car@@ e@@ er as an ad@@ ul@@ t , it was fil@@ m@@ making .
And that se@@ em@@ ed to be the best way to re@@ con@@ ci@@ le this ur@@ ge I had to tell stor@@ ies with my ur@@ ges to create ima@@ ges .
And I was , as a k@@ id , con@@ st@@ ant@@ ly dra@@ wing com@@ ic bo@@ o@@ ks , and so on .
So , fil@@ m@@ making was the way to put pic@@ tur@@ es and stor@@ ies together , and that made sense .
And of course the stor@@ ies that I ch@@ ose to tell were sci@@ ence f@@ ic@@ tion stor@@ ies : &quot; T@@ er@@ min@@ at@@ or , &quot; &quot; A@@ li@@ ens &quot; and &quot; The Ab@@ y@@ s@@ s . &quot;
And with &quot; The Ab@@ y@@ s@@ s , &quot; I was p@@ ut@@ ting together my love of under@@ water and di@@ ving with fil@@ m@@ making .
So , you know , mer@@ ging the two passi@@ ons .
S@@ om@@ e@@ thing interesting came out of &quot; The Ab@@ y@@ s@@ s , &quot; which was that to sol@@ ve a spec@@ i@@ fi@@ c n@@ ar@@ ra@@ tive problem on that fil@@ m , which was to create this kind of li@@ qu@@ id water cre@@ at@@ ure , we actually em@@ bra@@ c@@ ed compu@@ ter gener@@ ated an@@ ima@@ tion , C@@ G .
And this res@@ ul@@ ted in the first so@@ ft@@ -@@ sur@@ face char@@ ac@@ ter , C@@ G an@@ ima@@ tion that was ever in a mo@@ v@@ ie .
And even th@@ ough the fil@@ m didn &apos;t make any money -- bar@@ ely bro@@ ke even , I should say -- I wi@@ t@@ n@@ ess@@ ed something a@@ ma@@ zing , which is that the au@@ di@@ ence , the glob@@ al au@@ di@@ ence , was m@@ es@@ m@@ eri@@ zed by this ap@@ par@@ ent ma@@ gi@@ c .
You know , it &apos;s Ar@@ th@@ ur C@@ lar@@ ke &apos;s la@@ w that any su@@ ff@@ ic@@ i@@ ent@@ ly ad@@ v@@ an@@ c@@ ed technology is in@@ dis@@ t@@ ing@@ u@@ is@@ hab@@ le from ma@@ gi@@ c .
They were se@@ eing something ma@@ gi@@ cal .
And so that got me very ex@@ c@@ ited .
And I thought , &quot; W@@ ow , this is something that nee@@ ds to be em@@ bra@@ c@@ ed into the c@@ in@@ e@@ ma@@ tic art . &quot;
So , with &quot; T@@ er@@ min@@ at@@ or 2 , &quot; which was my next fil@@ m , we took that much f@@ ar@@ ther .
Wor@@ king with I@@ L@@ M , we cre@@ ated the li@@ qu@@ id m@@ et@@ al du@@ de in that fil@@ m . The su@@ c@@ cess h@@ ung in the b@@ al@@ ance on wh@@ e@@ ther that eff@@ ect would work .
And it did , and we cre@@ ated ma@@ gi@@ c again , and we had the same res@@ ul@@ t with an au@@ di@@ ence -- al@@ th@@ ough we did make a little more money on that one .
So , dra@@ wing a line through those two d@@ ots of experi@@ ence came to , &quot; This is going to be a whole new world , &quot; this was a whole new world of cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity for fil@@ m arti@@ st@@ s .
So , I started a comp@@ any with St@@ an W@@ in@@ st@@ on , my good fri@@ end St@@ an W@@ in@@ st@@ on , who is the pre@@ mi@@ er ma@@ k@@ e-@@ up and cre@@ at@@ ure desig@@ ner at that time , and it was called D@@ ig@@ ital D@@ om@@ ain .
And the con@@ ce@@ pt of the comp@@ any was that we would le@@ ap@@ f@@ ro@@ g p@@ ast the an@@ al@@ o@@ g pro@@ c@@ ess@@ es of op@@ tical pr@@ inter@@ s and so on , and we would go right to dig@@ ital produc@@ tion .
And we actually did that and it ga@@ ve us a com@@ pe@@ ti@@ tive ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ge for a whi@@ le .
But we found our@@ selves l@@ ag@@ ging in the m@@ id &apos; 9@@ 0@@ s in the cre@@ at@@ ure and char@@ ac@@ ter design stuff that we had actually fo@@ und@@ ed the comp@@ any to do .
So , I w@@ ro@@ te this piec@@ e called &quot; A@@ v@@ at@@ ar , &quot; which was me@@ ant to ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely p@@ us@@ h the en@@ vel@@ op@@ e of vis@@ u@@ al eff@@ ects , of C@@ G eff@@ ects , be@@ y@@ on@@ d , with re@@ alis@@ tic human em@@ o@@ tive char@@ ac@@ ters gener@@ ated in C@@ G , and the ma@@ in char@@ ac@@ ters would all be in C@@ G , and the world would be in C@@ G .
And the en@@ vel@@ op@@ e p@@ us@@ h@@ ed back , and I was t@@ old by the fol@@ ks at my comp@@ any that we wer@@ en &apos;t going to be able to do this for a whi@@ le .
So , I sh@@ el@@ ved it , and I made this other mo@@ v@@ ie about a big shi@@ p that sin@@ ks .
You know , I went and p@@ it@@ ch@@ ed it to the stu@@ di@@ o as &quot; &apos; R@@ om@@ e@@ o and J@@ u@@ lie@@ t &apos; on a shi@@ p : &quot; It &apos;s going to be this e@@ pi@@ c ro@@ man@@ ce , passi@@ on@@ ate fil@@ m . &quot;
S@@ ec@@ re@@ tly , what I wanted to do was I wanted to di@@ ve to the real w@@ re@@ ck of &quot; T@@ it@@ an@@ ic . &quot;
And that &apos;s why I made the mo@@ v@@ ie .
And that &apos;s the tru@@ th . Now , the stu@@ di@@ o didn &apos;t know that .
But I con@@ v@@ inc@@ ed them . I said , &quot; We &apos;re going to di@@ ve to the w@@ re@@ ck . We &apos;re going to fil@@ m it for real .
We &apos;ll be using it in the op@@ en@@ ing of the fil@@ m .
It will be really important . It will be a great mark@@ et@@ ing h@@ oo@@ k . &quot;
And I tal@@ ked them into f@@ und@@ ing an ex@@ pe@@ di@@ tion .
So@@ un@@ ds cra@@ z@@ y . But this go@@ es back to that the@@ me about your ima@@ g@@ in@@ ation cre@@ ating a re@@ ality .
Because we actually cre@@ ated a re@@ ality where si@@ x mon@@ ths l@@ ater , I find my@@ self in a R@@ us@@ si@@ an sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble two and a hal@@ f m@@ il@@ es down in the nor@@ th At@@ lan@@ tic , looking at the real T@@ it@@ an@@ ic through a vie@@ w p@@ ort .
N@@ ot a mo@@ v@@ ie , not H@@ D -- for real .
Now , that ble@@ w my m@@ ind .
And it took a lot of pre@@ par@@ ation , we had to bu@@ ild c@@ am@@ er@@ as and li@@ gh@@ ts and all kin@@ ds of things .
But , it stru@@ ck me how much this di@@ ve , these de@@ ep di@@ ves , was like a space mis@@ sion .
You know , where it was high@@ ly te@@ chni@@ cal , and it re@@ qui@@ red en@@ or@@ m@@ ous plan@@ ning .
You get in this cap@@ su@@ le , you go down to this dar@@ k h@@ os@@ ti@@ le en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment where there is no hop@@ e of res@@ c@@ ue if you can &apos;t get back by y@@ our@@ self .
And I thought like , &quot; W@@ ow . I &apos;m like , li@@ ving in a sci@@ ence f@@ ic@@ tion mo@@ v@@ ie .
This is really co@@ ol . &quot;
And so , I really got b@@ it@@ ten by the bu@@ g of de@@ ep@@ -@@ o@@ ce@@ an ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ation .
O@@ f course , the c@@ u@@ ri@@ os@@ ity , the sci@@ ence comp@@ on@@ ent of it -- it was everything . It was ad@@ v@@ ent@@ ure , it was c@@ u@@ ri@@ os@@ ity , it was ima@@ g@@ in@@ ation .
And it was an experi@@ ence that H@@ oll@@ y@@ wo@@ od cou@@ ldn &apos;t give me .
Because , you know , I could ima@@ g@@ ine a cre@@ at@@ ure and we could create a vis@@ u@@ al eff@@ ect for it . But I cou@@ ldn &apos;t ima@@ g@@ ine what I was se@@ eing out that win@@ d@@ ow .
A@@ s we did some of our sub@@ se@@ qu@@ ent ex@@ pe@@ di@@ tions , I was se@@ eing cre@@ at@@ ur@@ es at hy@@ dro@@ ther@@ mal v@@ ents and some@@ times things that I had never se@@ en before , some@@ times things that no one had se@@ en before , that actually were not des@@ cri@@ b@@ ed by sci@@ ence at the time that we sa@@ w them and ima@@ g@@ ed them .
So , I was comp@@ let@@ ely s@@ mit@@ ten by this , and had to do more .
And so , I actually made a kind of c@@ u@@ ri@@ ous de@@ c@@ isi@@ on .
A@@ f@@ ter the su@@ c@@ cess of &quot; T@@ it@@ an@@ ic , &quot; I said , &quot; OK , I &apos;m going to par@@ k my day j@@ ob as a H@@ oll@@ y@@ wo@@ od mo@@ v@@ ie ma@@ ker , and I &apos;m going to go be a f@@ ul@@ l@@ -@@ time ex@@ pl@@ or@@ er for a whi@@ le . &quot;
And so , we started plan@@ ning these ex@@ pe@@ di@@ tions .
And we wo@@ und up going to the B@@ is@@ mar@@ k , and ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ing it with ro@@ bo@@ tic v@@ eh@@ ic@@ les .
We went back to the T@@ it@@ an@@ ic w@@ re@@ ck .
We took little bot@@ s that we had cre@@ ated that sp@@ o@@ ol@@ ed a fi@@ ber op@@ tic .
And the idea was to go in and do an inter@@ i@@ or sur@@ v@@ ey of that shi@@ p , which had never been done .
N@@ o@@ body had ever loo@@ ked in@@ side the w@@ re@@ ck . They didn &apos;t have the means to do it , so we cre@@ ated technology to do it .
So , you know , here I am now , on the de@@ ck of T@@ it@@ an@@ ic , sit@@ ting in a sub@@ mer@@ si@@ ble , and looking out at plan@@ ks that look much like this , where I k@@ new that the b@@ and had pla@@ y@@ ed .
And I &apos;m fl@@ ying a little ro@@ bo@@ tic v@@ eh@@ ic@@ le through the cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or of the shi@@ p .
When I say , &quot; I &apos;m op@@ er@@ ating it , &quot; but my m@@ ind is in the v@@ eh@@ ic@@ le .
I f@@ elt like I was physi@@ c@@ ally pres@@ ent in@@ side the shi@@ p@@ w@@ re@@ ck of T@@ it@@ an@@ ic .
And it was the most sur@@ real kind of de@@ ja v@@ u experi@@ ence I &apos;ve ever had , because I would know before I tur@@ ned a cor@@ ner what was going to be there before the li@@ gh@@ ts of the v@@ eh@@ ic@@ le actually re@@ v@@ e@@ al@@ ed it , because I had w@@ al@@ ked the set for mon@@ ths when we were making the mo@@ v@@ ie .
And the set was bas@@ ed as an ex@@ act re@@ p@@ lic@@ a on the b@@ lu@@ e@@ pr@@ in@@ ts of the shi@@ p .
So , it was this ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely re@@ mark@@ able experi@@ ence .
And it really made me re@@ ali@@ ze that the tel@@ e@@ pres@@ ence experi@@ ence -- that you actually can have these ro@@ bo@@ tic av@@ at@@ ars , then your con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness is in@@ j@@ ec@@ ted into the v@@ eh@@ ic@@ le , into this other form of ex@@ ist@@ ence .
It was really , really quite pro@@ found .
And it may be a little bit of a g@@ li@@ mp@@ se as to what might be happen@@ ing some de@@ c@@ a@@ des out as we start to have c@@ y@@ bor@@ g bo@@ dies for ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ation or for other means in many sort of pos@@ t@@ -@@ human fut@@ ur@@ es that I can ima@@ g@@ ine , as a sci@@ ence f@@ ic@@ tion f@@ an .
So , ha@@ ving done these ex@@ pe@@ di@@ tions , and really beg@@ inn@@ ing to app@@ re@@ ci@@ ate what was down there , such as at the de@@ ep o@@ ce@@ an v@@ ents where we had these a@@ ma@@ zing , a@@ ma@@ zing an@@ im@@ als -- they &apos;re bas@@ ically ali@@ ens right here on Earth .
They live in an en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment of ch@@ em@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ is .
They don &apos;t sur@@ vi@@ ve on s@@ un@@ li@@ gh@@ t@@ -@@ bas@@ ed system the way we do .
And so , you &apos;re se@@ eing an@@ im@@ als that are li@@ ving next to water pl@@ um@@ es .
You think they can &apos;t possi@@ b@@ ly ex@@ ist .
A@@ t the same time I was getting very interes@@ ted in space sci@@ ence as well -- again , it &apos;s the sci@@ ence f@@ ic@@ tion in@@ f@@ lu@@ ence , as a k@@ id .
And I wo@@ und up getting in@@ vol@@ ved with the space comm@@ unity , really in@@ vol@@ ved with N@@ A@@ SA , sit@@ ting on the N@@ A@@ SA ad@@ vis@@ ory bo@@ ard , plan@@ ning ac@@ tu@@ al space mis@@ si@@ ons , going to R@@ us@@ si@@ a , going through the pre@@ -@@ c@@ os@@ mon@@ aut bi@@ om@@ e@@ di@@ cal pr@@ ot@@ o@@ col@@ s , and all these sor@@ ts of things , to actually go and f@@ ly to the inter@@ n@@ ational space st@@ ation with our 3@@ D c@@ am@@ er@@ a sy@@ stem@@ s .
And this was fas@@ c@@ in@@ ating .
But what I wo@@ und up doing was br@@ ing@@ ing space sci@@ enti@@ st@@ s with us into the de@@ ep .
And ta@@ king them down so that they had ac@@ cess -- ast@@ ro@@ bi@@ olog@@ is@@ ts , plan@@ et@@ ary sci@@ enti@@ st@@ s , people who were interes@@ ted in these ex@@ tre@@ me en@@ vi@@ ron@@ m@@ ents -- ta@@ king them down to the v@@ ents , and le@@ tting them see , and take sam@@ pl@@ es and t@@ est in@@ str@@ um@@ ents , and so on .
So , here we were making do@@ c@@ um@@ ent@@ ary fil@@ ms , but actually doing sci@@ ence , and actually doing space sci@@ ence .
I &apos;d comp@@ let@@ ely cl@@ os@@ ed the loo@@ p between being the sci@@ ence f@@ ic@@ tion f@@ an , you know , as a k@@ id , and doing this stuff for real .
And you know , al@@ ong the way in this j@@ our@@ ne@@ y of dis@@ co@@ very , I lear@@ ned a lot .
I lear@@ ned a lot about sci@@ ence . But I also lear@@ ned a lot about lea@@ der@@ shi@@ p .
Now you think di@@ rec@@ tor has got to be a lea@@ der , lea@@ der of , cap@@ tain of the shi@@ p , and all that sort of thing .
I didn &apos;t really lear@@ n about lea@@ der@@ shi@@ p un@@ ti@@ l I did these ex@@ pe@@ di@@ tions .
Because I had to , at a cer@@ tain point , say , &quot; What am I doing out here ?
Wh@@ y am I doing this ? What do I get out of it ? &quot;
We don &apos;t make money at these dam@@ n sho@@ ws .
We bar@@ ely bre@@ ak even . There is no f@@ ame in it .
P@@ e@@ ople sort of think I went away between &quot; T@@ it@@ an@@ ic &quot; and &quot; A@@ v@@ at@@ ar &quot; and was bu@@ ff@@ ing my n@@ a@@ il@@ s some@@ place , sit@@ ting at the be@@ ach .
Ma@@ de all these fil@@ ms , made all these do@@ c@@ um@@ ent@@ ary fil@@ ms for a very li@@ mit@@ ed au@@ di@@ ence .
No f@@ ame , no gl@@ ory , no money . What are you doing ?
You &apos;re doing it for the t@@ ask it@@ self , for the ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge -- and the o@@ ce@@ an is the most ch@@ all@@ en@@ ging en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment there is -- for the th@@ ri@@ ll of dis@@ co@@ very , and for that st@@ ran@@ ge b@@ on@@ d that happ@@ ens when a small grou@@ p of people form a ti@@ gh@@ tly k@@ n@@ it te@@ am .
Because we would do these things with 10 , 1@@ 2 people , working for years at a time , some@@ times at se@@ a for two , three mon@@ ths at a time .
And in that b@@ on@@ d , you re@@ ali@@ ze that the most important thing is the res@@ p@@ ect that you have for them and that they have for you , that you &apos;ve done a t@@ ask that you can &apos;t ex@@ pl@@ ain to some@@ one el@@ se .
When you come back to the sh@@ ore and you say , &quot; We had to do this , and the fi@@ ber op@@ tic , and the att@@ ent@@ u@@ ation , and the this and the that , all the technology of it , and the diff@@ ic@@ ul@@ ty , the hum@@ an@@ -@@ per@@ for@@ man@@ ce as@@ p@@ ects of working at se@@ a , &quot; you can &apos;t ex@@ pl@@ ain it to people . It &apos;s that thing that maybe c@@ op@@ s have , or people in com@@ b@@ at that have g@@ one through something together and they know they can never ex@@ pl@@ ain it .
C@@ re@@ ates a b@@ on@@ d , cre@@ ates a b@@ on@@ d of res@@ p@@ ect .
So , when I came back to make my next mo@@ v@@ ie , which was &quot; A@@ v@@ at@@ ar , &quot; I tri@@ ed to app@@ ly that same pr@@ in@@ ci@@ ple of lea@@ der@@ shi@@ p , which is that you res@@ p@@ ect your te@@ am , and you ear@@ n their res@@ p@@ ect in re@@ tur@@ n .
And it really chan@@ g@@ ed the d@@ y@@ nam@@ ic .
So , here I was again with a small te@@ am , in un@@ char@@ ted ter@@ rit@@ ory , doing &quot; A@@ v@@ at@@ ar , &quot; coming up with new technology that didn &apos;t ex@@ ist before .
T@@ re@@ men@@ d@@ ous@@ ly ex@@ c@@ it@@ ing .
T@@ re@@ men@@ d@@ ous@@ ly ch@@ all@@ en@@ ging .
And we bec@@ ame a fam@@ ily , over a f@@ our@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ hal@@ f year per@@ i@@ od .
And it comp@@ let@@ ely chan@@ g@@ ed how I do mo@@ vi@@ es .
So , people have comm@@ ent@@ ed on how , &quot; Well , you know , you br@@ ou@@ ght back the o@@ ce@@ an organ@@ is@@ ms and put them on the planet of P@@ and@@ or@@ a . &quot;
T@@ o me , it was more of a f@@ und@@ am@@ ent@@ al way of doing bus@@ iness , the pro@@ cess it@@ self , that chan@@ g@@ ed as a res@@ ul@@ t of that .
So , what can we sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ i@@ ze out of all this ?
You know , what are the l@@ ess@@ ons lear@@ ned ?
Well , I think number one is c@@ u@@ ri@@ os@@ ity .
It &apos;s the most po@@ wer@@ ful thing you own .
I@@ ma@@ g@@ in@@ ation is a for@@ ce that can actually man@@ i@@ f@@ est a re@@ ality .
And the res@@ p@@ ect of your te@@ am is more important than all the lau@@ rel@@ s in the world .
I have y@@ o@@ ung fil@@ m@@ ma@@ k@@ ers come up to me and say , &quot; G@@ i@@ ve me some ad@@ vi@@ ce for doing this . &quot;
And I say , &quot; D@@ on &apos;t put li@@ mit@@ ations on y@@ our@@ self .
O@@ ther people will do that for you -- don &apos;t do it to y@@ our@@ self , don &apos;t be@@ t ag@@ a@@ in@@ st y@@ our@@ self , and take ris@@ ks . &quot;
N@@ A@@ SA has this p@@ hr@@ ase that they like : &quot; F@@ a@@ il@@ ure is not an op@@ tion . &quot;
But fa@@ il@@ ure has to be an op@@ tion in art and in ex@@ pl@@ or@@ ation , because it &apos;s a lea@@ p of fa@@ it@@ h .
And no important en@@ de@@ a@@ vor that re@@ qui@@ red in@@ nov@@ ation was done with@@ out ris@@ k .
You have to be wi@@ ll@@ ing to take those ris@@ ks .
So , that &apos;s the thought I would lea@@ ve you with , is that in wh@@ at@@ ever you &apos;re doing , fa@@ il@@ ure is an op@@ tion , but fe@@ ar is not . Thank you .
If I can lea@@ ve you with one big idea today , it &apos;s that the whole of the data in which we con@@ su@@ me is gre@@ ater that the s@@ um of the par@@ ts , and in@@ ste@@ ad of thinking about in@@ formation o@@ ver@@ lo@@ ad , what I &apos;d like you to think about is how we can use in@@ formation so that pat@@ ter@@ ns po@@ p and we can see tr@@ ends that would o@@ ther@@ wis@@ e be inv@@ isi@@ ble .
So what we &apos;re looking at right here is a t@@ y@@ pic@@ al mor@@ tal@@ ity ch@@ art organ@@ i@@ zed by age .
This to@@ ol that I &apos;m using here is a little exper@@ im@@ ent .
It &apos;s called P@@ i@@ v@@ ot , and with P@@ i@@ v@@ ot what I can do is I can cho@@ ose to fil@@ ter in one partic@@ ular c@@ ause of de@@ a@@ ths -- say , ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ents .
And , right away , I see there &apos;s a different pat@@ tern that em@@ erg@@ es .
This is because , in the mi@@ d@@ -@@ are@@ a here , people are at their most ac@@ tive , and over here they &apos;re at their most fra@@ il .
We can ste@@ p back out again and then re@@ organ@@ i@@ ze the data by c@@ ause of de@@ at@@ h , se@@ eing that c@@ ir@@ cul@@ at@@ ory dis@@ eas@@ es and can@@ c@@ er are the us@@ u@@ al s@@ us@@ p@@ ects , but not for every@@ one .
If we go ah@@ e@@ ad and we fil@@ ter by age -- say 4@@ 0 years or less -- we see that ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ents are actually the gre@@ at@@ est c@@ ause that people have to be wor@@ ri@@ ed about .
And if you dri@@ ll into that , it &apos;s es@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ ally the c@@ ase for men .
So you get the idea that vie@@ wing in@@ formation , vie@@ wing data in this way , is a lot like s@@ wi@@ mm@@ ing in a li@@ ving in@@ formation in@@ fo@@ -@@ gr@@ ap@@ hi@@ c .
And if we can do this for ra@@ w data , why not do it for con@@ t@@ ent as well ?
So what we have right here is the co@@ ver of every s@@ ing@@ le S@@ por@@ ts I@@ l@@ lu@@ str@@ ated ever produc@@ ed .
It &apos;s all here ; it &apos;s all on the we@@ b .
You can go back to your ro@@ om@@ s and try this after my talk .
W@@ it@@ h P@@ i@@ v@@ ot , you can dri@@ ll into a de@@ c@@ ade .
You can dri@@ ll into a partic@@ ular year .
You can j@@ um@@ p right into a spec@@ i@@ fi@@ c is@@ su@@ e .
So I &apos;m looking at this ; I see the a@@ th@@ let@@ es that have ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed in this is@@ su@@ e , the sp@@ or@@ ts .
I &apos;m a L@@ ance Ar@@ m@@ str@@ ong f@@ an , so I &apos;ll go ah@@ e@@ ad and I &apos;ll cli@@ ck on that , which re@@ v@@ e@@ als , for me , all the is@@ su@@ es in which L@@ ance Ar@@ m@@ str@@ ong &apos;s been a part of .
Now , if I want to just kind of take a pe@@ e@@ k at these , I might think , &quot; Well , what about ta@@ king a look at all of c@@ y@@ cl@@ ing ? &quot;
So I can ste@@ p back , and exp@@ and on that .
And I see G@@ re@@ g Le@@ Mon@@ d now .
And so you get the idea that when you n@@ avi@@ g@@ ate over in@@ formation this way -- going n@@ ar@@ ro@@ wer , bro@@ a@@ der , b@@ ac@@ king in , b@@ ac@@ king out -- you &apos;re not se@@ ar@@ ch@@ ing , you &apos;re not bro@@ w@@ s@@ ing .
You &apos;re doing something that &apos;s actually a little bit different .
It &apos;s in between , and we think it chan@@ ges the way in@@ formation can be used .
So I want to ex@@ tr@@ ap@@ ol@@ ate on this idea a bit with something that &apos;s a little bit cra@@ z@@ y .
What we &apos;re done here is we &apos;ve ta@@ ken every s@@ ing@@ le Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a pa@@ ge and we re@@ duc@@ ed it down to a little su@@ mm@@ ary .
So the su@@ mm@@ ary con@@ s@@ is@@ ts of just a little sy@@ no@@ p@@ s@@ is and an ic@@ on to in@@ dic@@ ate the t@@ op@@ ic@@ al are@@ a that it comes from .
I &apos;m only sho@@ wing the top 5@@ 00 most p@@ op@@ ular Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a p@@ ag@@ es right here .
But even in this li@@ mit@@ ed vie@@ w , we can do a lot of things .
Ri@@ ght away , we get a sense of what are the t@@ op@@ ic@@ al d@@ om@@ a@@ ins that are most p@@ op@@ ular on Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a .
I &apos;m going to go ah@@ e@@ ad and sel@@ ect go@@ vern@@ ment .
Now , ha@@ ving sel@@ ec@@ ted go@@ vern@@ ment , I can now see that the Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a c@@ at@@ eg@@ or@@ ies that most fre@@ qu@@ ent@@ ly cor@@ res@@ pon@@ d to that are Ti@@ me ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine P@@ e@@ ople of the Y@@ e@@ ar .
So this is really important because this is an in@@ si@@ ght that was not con@@ ta@@ in@@ ed with@@ in any one Wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ di@@ a pa@@ ge .
It &apos;s only possible to see that in@@ si@@ ght when you ste@@ p back and look at all of them .
L@@ oo@@ king at one of these partic@@ ular su@@ mm@@ ar@@ ies , I can then dri@@ ll into the con@@ ce@@ pt of Ti@@ me ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine Per@@ son of the Y@@ e@@ ar , br@@ ing@@ ing up all of them .
So looking at these people , I can see that the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity come from go@@ vern@@ ment ; some have come from nat@@ ur@@ al sci@@ en@@ ces ; some , fe@@ wer still , have come from bus@@ iness -- there &apos;s my b@@ os@@ s -- and one has come from mus@@ ic .
And inter@@ est@@ ing@@ ly enough , B@@ on@@ o is also a TED P@@ ri@@ ze w@@ inn@@ er .
So we can go , j@@ um@@ p , and take a look at all the TED P@@ ri@@ ze w@@ inn@@ ers .
So you see , we &apos;re n@@ avi@@ g@@ ating the we@@ b for the first time as if it &apos;s actually a we@@ b , not from pa@@ ge@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ pa@@ ge , but at a high@@ er le@@ v@@ el of ab@@ stra@@ c@@ tion .
And so I want to show you one other thing that may c@@ at@@ ch you a little bit by sur@@ pr@@ is@@ e .
I &apos;m just sho@@ wing the New York T@@ im@@ es we@@ b@@ si@@ te here .
So P@@ i@@ v@@ ot , this app@@ lic@@ ation -- I don &apos;t want to call it a bro@@ w@@ ser ; it &apos;s really not a bro@@ w@@ ser , but you can vie@@ w we@@ b p@@ ag@@ es with it -- and we br@@ ing that z@@ o@@ om@@ able technology to every s@@ ing@@ le we@@ b pa@@ ge like this .
So I can ste@@ p back , po@@ p right back into a spec@@ i@@ fi@@ c s@@ ec@@ tion .
Now the reas@@ on why this is important is because , by vir@@ tu@@ e of just vie@@ wing we@@ b p@@ ag@@ es in this way , I can look at my enti@@ re bro@@ w@@ s@@ ing hist@@ ory in the ex@@ act same way .
So I can dri@@ ll into what I &apos;ve done over spec@@ i@@ fi@@ c time fra@@ m@@ es .
Here , in fact , is the st@@ ate of all the de@@ m@@ o that I just ga@@ ve .
And I can sort of re@@ play some stuff that I was looking at ear@@ li@@ er today .
And , if I want to ste@@ p back and look at everything , I can s@@ li@@ ce and di@@ ce my hist@@ ory , per@@ h@@ ap@@ s by my se@@ ar@@ ch hist@@ ory -- here , I was doing some ne@@ po@@ ti@@ sti@@ c se@@ ar@@ ch@@ ing , looking for B@@ ing , over here for Li@@ ve L@@ ab@@ s P@@ i@@ v@@ ot .
And from these , I can dri@@ ll into the we@@ b pa@@ ge and just la@@ un@@ ch them again .
It &apos;s one m@@ et@@ ap@@ h@@ or re@@ p@@ ur@@ pos@@ ed m@@ ul@@ ti@@ ple times , and in each c@@ ase it ma@@ kes the whole gre@@ ater than the s@@ um of the par@@ ts with the data .
So right now , in this world , we think about data as being this cur@@ se .
We talk about the cur@@ se of in@@ formation o@@ ver@@ lo@@ ad .
We talk about dro@@ w@@ ning in data .
What if we can actually tur@@ n that up@@ side down and tur@@ n the we@@ b up@@ side down , so that in@@ ste@@ ad of n@@ avi@@ g@@ ating from one thing to the next , we get used to the hab@@ it of being able to go from many things to many things , and then being able to see the pat@@ ter@@ ns that were o@@ ther@@ wis@@ e hi@@ d@@ den ?
If we can do that , then in@@ ste@@ ad of being tr@@ app@@ ed in data , we might actually ex@@ tra@@ c@@ t in@@ formation .
And , in@@ ste@@ ad of de@@ al@@ ing just with in@@ formation , we can te@@ ase out kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge .
And if we get the kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge , then maybe even there &apos;s wis@@ do@@ m to be found .
So with that , I th@@ ank you .
E@@ very@@ body tal@@ ks about happ@@ iness these da@@ ys .
I had some@@ body coun@@ t the number of bo@@ o@@ ks with &quot; happ@@ iness &quot; in the tit@@ le publi@@ sh@@ ed in the last five years and they ga@@ ve up after about 4@@ 0 , and there were many more .
There is a hu@@ ge wa@@ ve of inter@@ est in happ@@ iness , am@@ ong res@@ ear@@ ch@@ ers .
There is a lot of happ@@ iness co@@ ach@@ ing .
E@@ very@@ body would like to make people happ@@ ier .
But in spi@@ te of all this flo@@ od of work , there are se@@ ver@@ al c@@ og@@ ni@@ tive tr@@ ap@@ s that sort of make it al@@ most im@@ possible to think stra@@ i@@ ght about happ@@ iness .
And my talk today will be mos@@ tly about these c@@ og@@ ni@@ tive tr@@ ap@@ s .
This app@@ li@@ es to la@@ y@@ people thinking about their own happ@@ iness , and it app@@ li@@ es to sch@@ ol@@ ars thinking about happ@@ iness , because it tur@@ ns out we &apos;re just as m@@ ess@@ ed up as any@@ body el@@ se is .
The first of these tr@@ ap@@ s is a rel@@ u@@ c@@ t@@ ance to ad@@ mit comp@@ le@@ x@@ ity .
It tur@@ ns out that the wor@@ d &quot; happ@@ iness &quot; is just not a us@@ e@@ ful wor@@ d any@@ more , because we app@@ ly it to too many different things .
I think there is one partic@@ ular me@@ an@@ ing to which we might res@@ tri@@ c@@ t it , but by and lar@@ ge , this is something that we &apos;ll have to give up and we &apos;ll have to ad@@ op@@ t the more comp@@ lic@@ ated vie@@ w of what w@@ ell@@ -@@ being is .
The second tra@@ p is a con@@ f@@ usi@@ on between experi@@ ence and mem@@ ory ; bas@@ ically , it &apos;s between being happ@@ y in your life , and being happ@@ y about your life or happ@@ y with your life .
And those are two very different con@@ c@@ ep@@ ts , and they &apos;re bot@@ h l@@ um@@ p@@ ed in the no@@ tion of happ@@ iness .
And the th@@ ir@@ d is the fo@@ c@@ using ill@@ usi@@ on , and it &apos;s the un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ ate fact that we can &apos;t think about any c@@ ir@@ c@@ um@@ st@@ ance that aff@@ ects w@@ ell@@ -@@ being with@@ out dis@@ t@@ or@@ ting its import@@ ance .
I mean , this is a real c@@ og@@ ni@@ tive tra@@ p .
There &apos;s just no way of getting it right .
Now , I &apos;d like to start with an example of some@@ body who had a ques@@ tion@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ ans@@ wer s@@ es@@ sion after one of my lec@@ tur@@ es re@@ por@@ ted a story , and that was a story -- He said he &apos;d been li@@ st@@ en@@ ing to a sy@@ m@@ ph@@ on@@ y , and it was ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely gl@@ ori@@ ous mus@@ ic and at the very end of the rec@@ or@@ ding , there was a dre@@ ad@@ ful s@@ cre@@ e@@ ch@@ ing so@@ und .
And then he ad@@ ded , really quite em@@ o@@ tion@@ ally , it ru@@ in@@ ed the whole experi@@ ence .
But it ha@@ dn &apos;t .
What it had ru@@ in@@ ed were the mem@@ or@@ ies of the experi@@ ence .
He had had the experi@@ ence .
He had had 20 min@@ utes of gl@@ ori@@ ous mus@@ ic .
They coun@@ ted for no@@ thing because he was left with a mem@@ ory ; the mem@@ ory was ru@@ in@@ ed , and the mem@@ ory was all that he had g@@ ot@@ ten to ke@@ ep .
What this is tell@@ ing us , really , is that we might be thinking of our@@ selves and of other people in ter@@ ms of two selves .
There is an experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self , who li@@ ves in the pres@@ ent and kno@@ ws the pres@@ ent , is cap@@ able of re@@ -@@ li@@ ving the p@@ ast , but bas@@ ically it has only the pres@@ ent .
It &apos;s the experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self that the do@@ c@@ tor ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ es -- you know , when the do@@ c@@ tor as@@ ks , &quot; D@@ o@@ es it h@@ ur@@ t now when I t@@ ou@@ ch you here ? &quot;
And then there is a re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self , and the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self is the one that ke@@ ep@@ s sc@@ ore , and ma@@ in@@ ta@@ ins the story of our life , and it &apos;s the one that the do@@ c@@ tor ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ es in as@@ king the question , &quot; How have you been fe@@ el@@ ing l@@ at@@ ely ? &quot;
or &quot; How was your tri@@ p to Al@@ b@@ ani@@ a ? &quot; or something like that .
Th@@ ose are two very different enti@@ ties , the experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self and the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self , and getting con@@ f@@ used between them is part of the m@@ ess about the no@@ tion of happ@@ iness .
Now , the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self is a stor@@ y@@ tell@@ er .
And that really star@@ ts with a bas@@ ic res@@ pon@@ se of our mem@@ or@@ ies -- it star@@ ts im@@ medi@@ at@@ ely .
We don &apos;t only tell stor@@ ies when we set out to tell stor@@ ies .
O@@ ur mem@@ ory tell@@ s us stor@@ ies , that is , what we get to ke@@ ep from our experi@@ en@@ ces is a story .
And let me beg@@ in with one example .
This is an old stu@@ dy .
Th@@ ose are ac@@ tu@@ al pa@@ ti@@ ents under@@ going a pa@@ in@@ ful pro@@ ce@@ d@@ ure .
I w@@ on &apos;t go into de@@ ta@@ il . It &apos;s no l@@ on@@ ger pa@@ in@@ ful these da@@ ys , but it was pa@@ in@@ ful when this stu@@ dy was ru@@ n in the 19@@ 9@@ 0@@ s .
They were as@@ ked to re@@ p@@ ort on their pa@@ in every 6@@ 0 secon@@ ds .
Here are two pa@@ ti@@ ents , those are their rec@@ ord@@ ings .
And you are as@@ ked , &quot; Wh@@ o of them su@@ ff@@ er@@ ed more ? &quot;
And it &apos;s a very eas@@ y question .
C@@ lear@@ ly , P@@ ati@@ ent B su@@ ff@@ er@@ ed more -- his col@@ on@@ os@@ c@@ op@@ y was l@@ on@@ ger , and every min@@ ute of pa@@ in that P@@ ati@@ ent A had , P@@ ati@@ ent B had , and more .
But now there is another question : &quot; How much did these pa@@ ti@@ ents think they su@@ ff@@ er@@ ed ? &quot;
And here is a sur@@ pr@@ is@@ e .
The sur@@ pr@@ is@@ e is that P@@ ati@@ ent A had a much wor@@ se mem@@ ory of the col@@ on@@ os@@ c@@ op@@ y than P@@ ati@@ ent B .
The stor@@ ies of the col@@ on@@ os@@ c@@ op@@ ies were different , and because a very cri@@ tical part of the story is how it ends .
And n@@ ei@@ ther of these stor@@ ies is very in@@ sp@@ ir@@ ing or great -- but one of them is this dis@@ tin@@ c@@ t ... but one of them is dis@@ tin@@ c@@ tly wor@@ se than the other .
And the one that is wor@@ se is the one where pa@@ in was at its pe@@ ak at the very end ; it &apos;s a b@@ ad story .
How do we know that ?
Because we as@@ ked these people after their col@@ on@@ os@@ c@@ op@@ y , and much l@@ ater , too , &quot; How b@@ ad was the whole thing , in t@@ ot@@ al ? &quot;
And it was much wor@@ se for A than for B , in mem@@ ory .
Now this is a di@@ rec@@ t con@@ f@@ lic@@ t between the experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self and the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self .
F@@ rom the point of vie@@ w of the experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self , c@@ lear@@ ly , B had a wor@@ se time .
Now , what you could do with P@@ ati@@ ent A , and we actually r@@ an c@@ lin@@ ic@@ al exper@@ im@@ ents , and it has been done , and it does work -- you could actually ex@@ t@@ end the col@@ on@@ os@@ c@@ op@@ y of P@@ ati@@ ent A by just ke@@ ep@@ ing the tu@@ be in with@@ out j@@ ig@@ gl@@ ing it too much .
That will c@@ ause the pa@@ ti@@ ent to su@@ ff@@ er , but just a little and much less than before .
And if you do that for a cou@@ ple of min@@ utes , you have made the experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self of P@@ ati@@ ent A wor@@ se off , and you have the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self of P@@ ati@@ ent A a lot better off , because now you have en@@ do@@ w@@ ed P@@ ati@@ ent A with a better story about his experi@@ ence .
What de@@ fin@@ es a story ?
And that is tr@@ ue of the stor@@ ies that mem@@ ory de@@ li@@ ver@@ s for us , and it &apos;s also tr@@ ue of the stor@@ ies that we make up .
What de@@ fin@@ es a story are chan@@ ges , sig@@ ni@@ f@@ ic@@ ant m@@ om@@ ents and end@@ ings .
En@@ d@@ ings are very , very important and , in this c@@ ase , the en@@ ding d@@ om@@ in@@ ated .
Now , the experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self li@@ ves its life con@@ tin@@ u@@ ous@@ ly .
It has m@@ om@@ ents of experi@@ ence , one after the other .
And you can ask : What happ@@ ens to these m@@ om@@ ents ?
And the ans@@ wer is really stra@@ i@@ gh@@ t@@ for@@ ward : They are l@@ ost for@@ ever .
I mean , most of the m@@ om@@ ents of our life -- and I c@@ al@@ cul@@ ated , you know , the p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ologi@@ cal pres@@ ent is said to be about three secon@@ ds long ; that means that , you know , in a life there are about 6@@ 00 million of them ; in a mon@@ th , there are about 6@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,000 -- most of them don &apos;t lea@@ ve a tra@@ ce .
M@@ ost of them are comp@@ let@@ ely ig@@ nor@@ ed by the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self .
And y@@ et , som@@ eh@@ ow you get the sense that they should coun@@ t , that what happ@@ ens dur@@ ing these m@@ om@@ ents of experi@@ ence is our life .
It &apos;s the fin@@ i@@ te res@@ our@@ ce that we &apos;re sp@@ en@@ ding whi@@ le we &apos;re on this ear@@ th .
And how to sp@@ end it would se@@ em to be rel@@ ev@@ ant , but that is not the story that the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self ke@@ ep@@ s for us .
So we have the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self and the experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self , and they &apos;re really quite dis@@ tin@@ c@@ t .
The b@@ ig@@ ges@@ t differ@@ ence between them is in the hand@@ l@@ ing of time .
F@@ rom the point of vie@@ w of the experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self , if you have a v@@ ac@@ ation , and the second we@@ e@@ k is just as good as the first , then the t@@ wo@@ -@@ we@@ e@@ k v@@ ac@@ ation is t@@ wi@@ ce as good as the on@@ e-@@ we@@ e@@ k v@@ ac@@ ation .
That &apos;s not the way it wor@@ ks at all for the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self .
F@@ or the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self , a t@@ wo@@ -@@ we@@ e@@ k v@@ ac@@ ation is bar@@ ely better than the on@@ e-@@ we@@ e@@ k v@@ ac@@ ation because there are no new mem@@ or@@ ies ad@@ ded .
You have not chan@@ g@@ ed the story .
And in this way , time is actually the cri@@ tical v@@ ari@@ able that dis@@ t@@ ing@@ u@@ is@@ h@@ es a re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self from an experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self ; time has very little imp@@ act on the story .
Now , the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self does more than re@@ mem@@ ber and tell stor@@ ies .
It is actually the one that ma@@ kes de@@ c@@ isi@@ ons because , if you have a pa@@ ti@@ ent who has had , say , two col@@ on@@ os@@ c@@ op@@ ies with two different sur@@ ge@@ ons and is de@@ ci@@ ding which of them to cho@@ ose , then the one that cho@@ os@@ es is the one that has the mem@@ ory that is less b@@ ad , and that &apos;s the sur@@ ge@@ on that will be ch@@ os@@ en .
The experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self has no v@@ o@@ ice in this cho@@ ice .
We actually don &apos;t cho@@ ose between experi@@ en@@ ces , we cho@@ ose between mem@@ or@@ ies of experi@@ en@@ ces .
And even when we think about the future , we don &apos;t think of our future nor@@ m@@ ally as experi@@ en@@ ces .
We think of our future as an@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated mem@@ or@@ ies .
And bas@@ ically you can look at this , you know , as a t@@ y@@ ran@@ n@@ y of the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self , and you can think of the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self sort of dra@@ g@@ ging the experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self through experi@@ en@@ ces that the experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self doesn &apos;t need .
I have that sense that when we go on v@@ ac@@ ations this is very fre@@ qu@@ ent@@ ly the c@@ ase ; that is , we go on v@@ ac@@ ations , to a very lar@@ ge ex@@ t@@ ent , in the ser@@ vi@@ ce of our re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self .
And this is a bit har@@ d to j@@ us@@ ti@@ f@@ y I think .
I mean , how much do we con@@ su@@ me our mem@@ or@@ ies ?
That is one of the ex@@ plan@@ ations that is gi@@ ven for the d@@ om@@ in@@ ance of the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self .
And when I think about that , I think about a v@@ ac@@ ation we had in Ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic@@ a a few years ago , which was c@@ lear@@ ly the best v@@ ac@@ ation I &apos;ve ever had , and I think of it rel@@ ati@@ v@@ ely o@@ ften , rel@@ ative to how much I think of other v@@ ac@@ ations .
And I probably have con@@ su@@ m@@ ed my mem@@ or@@ ies of that th@@ re@@ e-@@ we@@ e@@ k tri@@ p , I would say , for about 2@@ 5 min@@ utes in the last four years .
Now , if I had ever op@@ en@@ ed the fol@@ der with the 6@@ 00 pic@@ tur@@ es in it , I would have sp@@ ent another h@@ our .
Now , that is three we@@ e@@ ks , and that is at most an h@@ our and a hal@@ f .
There se@@ em@@ s to be a dis@@ cre@@ p@@ an@@ cy .
Now , I may be a bit ex@@ tre@@ me , you know , in how little ap@@ pe@@ ti@@ te I have for con@@ su@@ m@@ ing mem@@ or@@ ies , but even if you do more of this , there is a gen@@ u@@ ine question : Wh@@ y do we put so much wei@@ ght on mem@@ ory rel@@ ative to the wei@@ ght that we put on experi@@ en@@ ces ?
So I want you to think about a thought exper@@ im@@ ent .
I@@ ma@@ g@@ ine that for your next v@@ ac@@ ation , you know that at the end of the v@@ ac@@ ation all your pic@@ tur@@ es will be des@@ tro@@ y@@ ed , and you &apos;ll get an am@@ n@@ es@@ ic dru@@ g so that you w@@ on &apos;t re@@ mem@@ ber anything .
Now , would you cho@@ ose the same v@@ ac@@ ation ? And if you would cho@@ ose a different v@@ ac@@ ation , there is a con@@ f@@ lic@@ t between your two selves , and you need to think about how to ad@@ j@@ u@@ dic@@ ate that con@@ f@@ lic@@ t , and it &apos;s actually not at all ob@@ vi@@ ous , because if you think in ter@@ ms of time , then you get one ans@@ wer , and if you think in ter@@ ms of mem@@ or@@ ies , you might get another ans@@ wer .
Wh@@ y do we pic@@ k the v@@ ac@@ ations we do is a problem that con@@ f@@ ron@@ ts us with a cho@@ ice between the two selves .
Now , the two selves br@@ ing up two no@@ tions of happ@@ iness .
There are really two con@@ c@@ ep@@ ts of happ@@ iness that we can app@@ ly , one per self .
So you can ask : How happ@@ y is the experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self ?
And then you would ask : How happ@@ y are the m@@ om@@ ents in the experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self &apos;s life ?
And they &apos;re all -- happ@@ iness for m@@ om@@ ents is a fa@@ ir@@ ly comp@@ lic@@ ated pro@@ cess .
What are the em@@ o@@ tions that can be me@@ as@@ u@@ red ?
And , by the way , now we are cap@@ able of getting a pretty good idea of the happ@@ iness of the experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self over time .
If you ask for the happ@@ iness of the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self , it &apos;s a comp@@ let@@ ely different thing .
This is not about how happ@@ ily a person li@@ ves .
It is about how sa@@ ti@@ s@@ fi@@ ed or ple@@ as@@ ed the person is when that person thin@@ ks about her life .
Ver@@ y different no@@ tion .
An@@ y@@ one who doesn &apos;t dis@@ t@@ ing@@ u@@ ish those no@@ tions is going to m@@ ess up the stu@@ dy of happ@@ iness , and I bel@@ ong to a c@@ ro@@ w@@ d of stu@@ d@@ ents of w@@ ell@@ -@@ being , who &apos;ve been m@@ ess@@ ing up the stu@@ dy of happ@@ iness for a long time in pre@@ c@@ is@@ ely this way .
The dis@@ tin@@ c@@ tion between the happ@@ iness of the experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self and the sa@@ ti@@ s@@ fac@@ tion of the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self has been rec@@ og@@ ni@@ zed in rec@@ ent years , and there are now eff@@ or@@ ts to me@@ as@@ ure the two se@@ par@@ at@@ ely .
The G@@ all@@ up Or@@ gan@@ i@@ z@@ ation has a world p@@ ol@@ l where more than hal@@ f a million people have been as@@ ked ques@@ tions about what they think of their life and about their experi@@ en@@ ces , and there have been other eff@@ or@@ ts al@@ ong those lin@@ es .
So in rec@@ ent years , we have beg@@ un to lear@@ n about the happ@@ iness of the two selves .
And the ma@@ in l@@ ess@@ on I think that we have lear@@ ned is they are really different .
You can know how sa@@ ti@@ s@@ fi@@ ed some@@ body is with their life , and that really doesn &apos;t te@@ ach you much about how happ@@ ily they &apos;re li@@ ving their life , and vi@@ ce vers@@ a .
J@@ ust to give you a sense of the cor@@ rel@@ ation , the cor@@ rel@@ ation is about .@@ 5 .
What that means is if you me@@ t some@@ body , and you were t@@ old , &quot; Oh his fa@@ ther is si@@ x fe@@ et t@@ all , &quot; how much would you know about his hei@@ ght ?
Well , you would know something about his hei@@ ght , but there &apos;s a lot of un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ty .
You have that much un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ty .
If I tell you that some@@ body ran@@ ked their life ei@@ ght on a sc@@ ale of ten , you have a lot of un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ty about how happ@@ y they are with their experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self .
So the cor@@ rel@@ ation is low .
We know something about what con@@ tro@@ l@@ s sa@@ ti@@ s@@ fac@@ tion of the happ@@ iness self .
We know that money is very important , go@@ als are very important .
We know that happ@@ iness is ma@@ in@@ ly being sa@@ ti@@ s@@ fi@@ ed with people that we like , sp@@ en@@ ding time with people that we like .
There are other ple@@ as@@ ur@@ es , but this is d@@ om@@ in@@ ant .
So if you want to ma@@ x@@ im@@ i@@ ze the happ@@ iness of the two selves , you are going to end up doing very different things .
The bot@@ to@@ m line of what I &apos;ve said here is that we really should not think of happ@@ iness as a sub@@ sti@@ tu@@ te for w@@ ell@@ -@@ being .
It is a comp@@ let@@ ely different no@@ tion .
Now , very qui@@ ck@@ ly , another reas@@ on we can@@ not think stra@@ i@@ ght about happ@@ iness is that we do not att@@ end to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live .
So , if you ask the sim@@ ple question of how happ@@ y people are in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a , you are not going to get to the cor@@ rec@@ t ans@@ wer .
When you ask that question , you think people m@@ ust be happ@@ ier in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a if , say , you live in O@@ hi@@ o .
And what happ@@ ens is when you think about li@@ ving in C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a , you are thinking of the con@@ tr@@ ast between C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a and other plac@@ es , and that con@@ tr@@ ast , say , is in cli@@ ma@@ te .
Well , it tur@@ ns out that cli@@ ma@@ te is not very important to the experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self and it &apos;s not even very important to the re@@ f@@ lec@@ tive self that de@@ ci@@ des how happ@@ y people are .
But now , because the re@@ f@@ lec@@ tive self is in char@@ ge , you may end up -- some people may end up mo@@ ving to C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a .
And it &apos;s sort of interesting to tra@@ ce what is going to happ@@ en to people who mo@@ ve to C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a in the hop@@ e of getting happ@@ ier .
Well , their experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self is not going to get happ@@ ier .
We know that .
But one thing will happ@@ en : They will think they are happ@@ ier , because , when they think about it , they &apos;ll be re@@ min@@ ded of how h@@ or@@ ri@@ ble the we@@ a@@ ther was in O@@ hi@@ o , and they will feel they made the right de@@ c@@ isi@@ on .
It is very diff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t to think stra@@ i@@ ght about w@@ ell@@ -@@ being , and I hop@@ e I have gi@@ ven you a sense of how diff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t it is .
Thank you .
Chr@@ is An@@ der@@ son : Thank you . I &apos;ve got a question for you .
Thank you so much .
Now , when we were on the ph@@ one a few we@@ e@@ ks ago , you men@@ tion@@ ed to me that there was quite an interesting res@@ ul@@ t came out of that G@@ all@@ up sur@@ v@@ ey .
I@@ s that something you can sh@@ are sin@@ ce you do have a few m@@ om@@ ents left now ?
D@@ ani@@ el K@@ ah@@ ne@@ man : S@@ ure .
I think the most interesting res@@ ul@@ t that we found in the G@@ all@@ up sur@@ v@@ ey is a number , which we ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely did not exp@@ ect to find .
We found that with res@@ p@@ ect to the happ@@ iness of the experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self .
When we loo@@ ked at how fe@@ el@@ ings , v@@ ary with in@@ come .
And it tur@@ ns out that , bel@@ ow an in@@ come of 6@@ 0@@ ,000 dollars a year , for A@@ mer@@ ic@@ ans -- and that &apos;s a very lar@@ ge sam@@ ple of A@@ mer@@ ic@@ ans , like 6@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,000 , so it &apos;s a lar@@ ge re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ative sam@@ ple -- bel@@ ow an in@@ come of 6@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,000 dollars a year ...
C@@ A : 6@@ 0@@ ,000 .
D@@ K : 6@@ 0@@ ,000 .
6@@ 0@@ ,000 dollars a year , people are un@@ happ@@ y , and they get pro@@ g@@ res@@ si@@ v@@ ely un@@ happ@@ ier the po@@ or@@ er they get .
A@@ bo@@ ve that , we get an ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely fl@@ at line .
I mean I &apos;ve r@@ ar@@ ely se@@ en lin@@ es so fl@@ at .
C@@ lear@@ ly , what is happen@@ ing is money does not bu@@ y you experi@@ enti@@ al happ@@ iness , but l@@ ack of money cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly bu@@ ys you mis@@ er@@ y , and we can me@@ as@@ ure that mis@@ er@@ y very , very c@@ lear@@ ly .
In ter@@ ms of the other self , the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self , you get a different story .
The more money you ear@@ n , the more sa@@ ti@@ s@@ fi@@ ed you are .
That does not h@@ old for em@@ o@@ tions .
C@@ A : But D@@ an@@ n@@ y , the whole Ameri@@ can en@@ de@@ a@@ vor is about life , li@@ ber@@ ty , the p@@ ur@@ su@@ it of happ@@ iness .
If people took s@@ eri@@ ous@@ ly that fin@@ ding , I mean , it se@@ em@@ s to tur@@ n up@@ side down everything we believe about , like for example , ta@@ x@@ ation po@@ lic@@ y and so for@@ th .
I@@ s there any chan@@ ce that poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans , that the country gener@@ ally , would take a fin@@ ding like that s@@ eri@@ ous@@ ly and ru@@ n publi@@ c po@@ lic@@ y bas@@ ed on it ?
D@@ K : You know I think that there is rec@@ og@@ ni@@ tion of the ro@@ le of happ@@ iness res@@ ear@@ ch in publi@@ c po@@ lic@@ y .
The rec@@ og@@ ni@@ tion is going to be s@@ low in the Un@@ ited St@@ ates , no question about that , but in the U@@ .@@ K@@ . , it is happen@@ ing , and in other coun@@ tri@@ es it is happen@@ ing .
P@@ e@@ ople are rec@@ og@@ ni@@ zing that they ou@@ ght to be thinking of happ@@ iness when they think of publi@@ c po@@ lic@@ y .
It &apos;s going to take a whi@@ le , and people are going to de@@ b@@ ate wh@@ e@@ ther they want to stu@@ dy experi@@ ence happ@@ iness , or wh@@ e@@ ther they want to stu@@ dy life ev@@ al@@ u@@ ation , so we need to have that de@@ b@@ ate fa@@ ir@@ ly so@@ on .
How to en@@ h@@ ance happ@@ iness go@@ es very different ways de@@ p@@ en@@ ding on how you think , and wh@@ e@@ ther you think of the re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ing self or you think of the experi@@ en@@ c@@ ing self .
This is going to in@@ f@@ lu@@ ence po@@ lic@@ y , I think , in years to come .
In the Un@@ ited St@@ ates , eff@@ or@@ ts are being made to me@@ as@@ ure the experi@@ ence happ@@ iness of the p@@ op@@ ul@@ ation .
This is going to be , I think , with@@ in the next de@@ c@@ ade or two , part of n@@ ational st@@ ati@@ sti@@ c@@ s .
C@@ A : Well , it se@@ em@@ s to me that this is@@ su@@ e will -- or at le@@ ast should be -- the most interesting po@@ lic@@ y dis@@ c@@ us@@ sion to tra@@ ck over the next few years .
Thank you so much for inv@@ ent@@ ing beh@@ avi@@ or@@ al econom@@ ic@@ s .
Thank you , D@@ an@@ n@@ y K@@ ah@@ ne@@ man .
I &apos;m going to talk today about energy and cli@@ ma@@ te .
And that might se@@ em a bit sur@@ pr@@ is@@ ing because my f@@ ul@@ l@@ -@@ time work at the F@@ o@@ un@@ da@@ tion is mos@@ tly about v@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ es and se@@ e@@ ds , about the things that we need to inv@@ ent and de@@ li@@ ver to help the po@@ or@@ est two b@@ illion live better li@@ ves .
But energy and cli@@ ma@@ te are ex@@ tre@@ m@@ ely important to these people -- in fact , more important than to any@@ one el@@ se on the planet .
The cli@@ ma@@ te getting wor@@ se means that many years , their c@@ ro@@ ps w@@ on &apos;t gro@@ w : There will be too much ra@@ in , not enough ra@@ in , things will change in ways that their fra@@ gi@@ le en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment sim@@ p@@ ly can &apos;t supp@@ ort .
And that lea@@ ds to star@@ v@@ ation , it lea@@ ds to un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ty , it lea@@ ds to un@@ res@@ t .
So , the cli@@ ma@@ te chan@@ ges will be ter@@ ri@@ ble for them .
Also , the pri@@ ce of energy is very important to them .
In fact , if you could pic@@ k just one thing to lo@@ wer the pri@@ ce of , to re@@ du@@ ce po@@ ver@@ ty , by f@@ ar you would pic@@ k energy .
Now , the pri@@ ce of energy has come down over time .
Re@@ ally ad@@ v@@ an@@ c@@ ed ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation is bas@@ ed on ad@@ v@@ an@@ ces in energy .
The co@@ al re@@ vol@@ ution fu@@ el@@ ed the In@@ du@@ stri@@ al R@@ evol@@ ution , and , even in the 19@@ 0@@ 0@@ s we &apos;ve se@@ en a very rap@@ id de@@ cl@@ ine in the pri@@ ce of elec@@ tri@@ city , and that &apos;s why we have re@@ fri@@ ger@@ at@@ ors , a@@ ir@@ -@@ con@@ di@@ tion@@ ing , we can make mo@@ dern mat@@ eri@@ als and do so many things .
And so , we &apos;re in a w@@ onder@@ ful sit@@ u@@ ation with elec@@ tri@@ city in the r@@ ich world .
But , as we make it ch@@ e@@ ap@@ er -- and let &apos;s go for making it t@@ wi@@ ce as ch@@ e@@ a@@ p -- we need to me@@ et a new con@@ stra@@ int , and that con@@ stra@@ int has to do with C@@ O@@ 2 .
C@@ O@@ 2 is war@@ m@@ ing the planet , and the e@@ qu@@ ation on C@@ O@@ 2 is actually a very stra@@ i@@ gh@@ t@@ for@@ ward one .
If you s@@ um up the C@@ O@@ 2 that ge@@ ts em@@ it@@ ted , that lea@@ ds to a tem@@ per@@ at@@ ure incre@@ ase , and that tem@@ per@@ at@@ ure incre@@ ase lea@@ ds to some very ne@@ g@@ ative eff@@ ects : the eff@@ ects on the we@@ a@@ ther ; per@@ h@@ ap@@ s wor@@ se , the in@@ di@@ rec@@ t eff@@ ects , in that the nat@@ ur@@ al ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem@@ s can &apos;t ad@@ just to these rap@@ id chan@@ ges , and so you get ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem c@@ oll@@ ap@@ s@@ es .
Now , the ex@@ act am@@ o@@ un@@ t of how you ma@@ p from a cer@@ tain incre@@ ase of C@@ O@@ 2 to what tem@@ per@@ at@@ ure will be and where the posi@@ tive fe@@ e@@ d@@ b@@ ac@@ ks are , there &apos;s some un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ty there , but not very much .
And there &apos;s cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly un@@ cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ty about how b@@ ad those eff@@ ects will be , but they will be ex@@ tre@@ m@@ ely b@@ ad .
I as@@ ked the top sci@@ enti@@ st@@ s on this se@@ ver@@ al times : D@@ o we really have to get down to ne@@ ar z@@ er@@ o ?
C@@ an &apos;t we just c@@ ut it in hal@@ f or a qu@@ ar@@ ter ?
And the ans@@ wer is that un@@ ti@@ l we get ne@@ ar to z@@ er@@ o , the tem@@ per@@ at@@ ure will con@@ tin@@ ue to ris@@ e .
And so that &apos;s a big ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge .
It &apos;s very different than sa@@ ying &quot; We &apos;re a t@@ wel@@ v@@ e-@@ fo@@ ot@@ -@@ hi@@ gh tru@@ ck trying to get un@@ der a ten@@ -@@ fo@@ ot bri@@ dge , and we can just sort of s@@ qu@@ e@@ e@@ ze un@@ der . &quot;
This is something that has to get to z@@ er@@ o .
Now , we put out a lot of car@@ b@@ on di@@ o@@ x@@ i@@ de every year , over 2@@ 6 b@@ illion t@@ ons .
F@@ or each Ameri@@ can , it &apos;s about 20 t@@ ons ; for people in po@@ or coun@@ tri@@ es , it &apos;s less than one ton .
It &apos;s an a@@ ver@@ age of about five t@@ ons for every@@ one on the planet .
And , som@@ eh@@ ow , we have to make chan@@ ges that will br@@ ing that down to z@@ er@@ o .
It &apos;s been con@@ st@@ ant@@ ly going up .
It &apos;s only v@@ ari@@ ous econom@@ ic chan@@ ges that have even fl@@ at@@ ten@@ ed it at all , so we have to go from rap@@ i@@ d@@ ly ris@@ ing to f@@ all@@ ing , and f@@ all@@ ing all the way to z@@ er@@ o .
This e@@ qu@@ ation has four fac@@ t@@ ors , a little bit of m@@ ul@@ ti@@ p@@ lic@@ ation : So , you &apos;ve got a thing on the left , C@@ O@@ 2 , that you want to get to z@@ er@@ o , and that &apos;s going to be bas@@ ed on the number of people , the ser@@ vi@@ ces each person &apos;s using on a@@ ver@@ age , the energy on a@@ ver@@ age for each ser@@ vi@@ ce , and the C@@ O@@ 2 being put out per un@@ it of energy .
So , let &apos;s look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to z@@ er@@ o .
Pro@@ bab@@ ly , one of these num@@ ber@@ s is going to have to get pretty ne@@ ar to z@@ er@@ o .
Now that &apos;s back from hi@@ gh school al@@ ge@@ br@@ a , but let &apos;s take a look .
F@@ ir@@ st , we &apos;ve got p@@ op@@ ul@@ ation .
The world today has 6@@ .@@ 8 b@@ illion people .
That &apos;s he@@ ad@@ ed up to about n@@ ine b@@ illion .
Now , if we do a really great j@@ ob on new v@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ es , heal@@ th c@@ are , re@@ produc@@ tive heal@@ th ser@@ vi@@ ces , we could lo@@ wer that by , per@@ h@@ ap@@ s , 10 or 15 percent , but there we see an incre@@ ase of about 1@@ .@@ 3 .
The second fac@@ tor is the ser@@ vi@@ ces we use .
This en@@ comp@@ ass@@ es everything : the food we e@@ at , c@@ lo@@ thing , T@@ V , he@@ ating .
These are very good things : getting ri@@ d of po@@ ver@@ ty means pro@@ vi@@ ding these ser@@ vi@@ ces to al@@ most every@@ one on the planet .
And it &apos;s a great thing for this number to go up .
In the r@@ ich world , per@@ h@@ ap@@ s the top one b@@ illion , we probably could c@@ ut back and use less , but every year , this number , on a@@ ver@@ age , is going to go up , and so , over all , that will more than d@@ ou@@ ble the ser@@ vi@@ ces de@@ li@@ ver@@ ed per person .
Here we have a very bas@@ ic ser@@ vi@@ ce : D@@ o you have li@@ gh@@ ting in your h@@ ou@@ se to be able to re@@ ad your h@@ om@@ e@@ work ?
And , in fact , these kids don &apos;t , so they &apos;re going out and read@@ ing their school work un@@ der the stre@@ et l@@ am@@ ps .
Now , eff@@ ic@@ i@@ en@@ cy , E , the energy for each ser@@ vi@@ ce , here fin@@ ally we have some good ne@@ ws .
We have something that &apos;s not going up .
Th@@ r@@ ough v@@ ari@@ ous inv@@ en@@ tions and new ways of doing li@@ gh@@ ting , through different t@@ yp@@ es of c@@ ars , different ways of building buil@@ d@@ ings -- there are a lot of ser@@ vi@@ ces where you can br@@ ing the energy for that ser@@ vi@@ ce down quite sub@@ st@@ an@@ ti@@ ally .
S@@ ome in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al ser@@ vi@@ ces even br@@ ing it down by 9@@ 0 percent .
There are other ser@@ vi@@ ces like how we make fer@@ ti@@ li@@ z@@ er , or how we do a@@ ir tr@@ an@@ sp@@ ort , where the ro@@ om@@ s for im@@ pro@@ v@@ em@@ ent are f@@ ar , f@@ ar less .
And so , o@@ ver@@ all here , if we &apos;re op@@ tim@@ is@@ tic , we may get a re@@ duc@@ tion of a fac@@ tor of three to even , per@@ h@@ ap@@ s , a fac@@ tor of si@@ x .
But for these first three fac@@ t@@ ors now , we &apos;ve g@@ one from 2@@ 6 b@@ illion to , at best , maybe 1@@ 3 b@@ illion t@@ ons , and that just w@@ on &apos;t c@@ ut it .
So let &apos;s look at this f@@ our@@ th fac@@ tor -- this is going to be a k@@ ey one -- and this is the am@@ o@@ un@@ t of C@@ O@@ 2 put out per each un@@ it of energy .
And so the question is : C@@ an you actually get that to z@@ er@@ o ?
If you b@@ ur@@ n co@@ al , no .
If you b@@ ur@@ n nat@@ ur@@ al g@@ as , no .
Al@@ most every way we make elec@@ tri@@ city today , ex@@ ce@@ pt for the em@@ erg@@ ing r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ ab@@ les and n@@ u@@ cle@@ ar , pu@@ ts out C@@ O@@ 2 .
And so , what we &apos;re going to have to do at a glob@@ al sc@@ ale , is create a new system .
And so , we need energy mi@@ ra@@ c@@ les .
Now , when I use the ter@@ m &quot; mi@@ ra@@ c@@ le , &quot; I don &apos;t mean something that &apos;s im@@ possible .
The m@@ ic@@ ro@@ pro@@ c@@ ess@@ or is a mi@@ ra@@ c@@ le . The per@@ son@@ al compu@@ ter is a mi@@ ra@@ c@@ le .
The Internet and its ser@@ vi@@ ces are a mi@@ ra@@ c@@ le .
So , the people here have par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated in the cre@@ ation of many mi@@ ra@@ c@@ les .
U@@ su@@ ally , we don &apos;t have a de@@ ad@@ line , where you have to get the mi@@ ra@@ c@@ le by a cer@@ tain da@@ te .
U@@ su@@ ally , you just kind of stand by , and some come al@@ ong , some don &apos;t .
This is a c@@ ase where we actually have to dri@@ ve at f@@ ul@@ l spe@@ ed and get a mi@@ ra@@ c@@ le in a pretty ti@@ ght tim@@ el@@ ine .
Now , I thought , &quot; How could I really cap@@ ture this ?
I@@ s there some kind of nat@@ ur@@ al il@@ lu@@ stra@@ tion , some de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion that would gra@@ b people &apos;s ima@@ g@@ in@@ ation here ? &quot;
I thought back to a year ago when I br@@ ou@@ ght mos@@ qu@@ it@@ os , and som@@ eh@@ ow people en@@ j@@ o@@ y@@ ed that .
It really got them in@@ vol@@ ved in the idea of , you know , there are people who live with mos@@ qu@@ it@@ os .
So , with energy , all I could come up with is this .
I de@@ ci@@ ded that rel@@ eas@@ ing fi@@ re@@ f@@ li@@ es would be my con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion to the en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment here this year .
So here we have some nat@@ ur@@ al fi@@ re@@ f@@ li@@ es .
I &apos;m t@@ old they don &apos;t bi@@ te ; in fact , they might not even lea@@ ve that j@@ ar .
Now , there &apos;s all sor@@ ts of gi@@ m@@ mi@@ ck@@ y sol@@ u@@ tions like that one , but they don &apos;t really ad@@ d up to much .
We need sol@@ u@@ tions -- ei@@ ther one or se@@ ver@@ al -- that have un@@ be@@ li@@ ev@@ able sc@@ ale and un@@ be@@ li@@ ev@@ able re@@ li@@ abili@@ ty , and , al@@ th@@ ough there &apos;s many di@@ rec@@ tions people are se@@ e@@ king , I really only see five that can ach@@ ie@@ ve the big num@@ ber@@ s .
I &apos;ve left out ti@@ de , ge@@ o@@ ther@@ mal , f@@ usi@@ on , bi@@ o@@ fu@@ els .
Th@@ ose may make some con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion , and if they can do better than I exp@@ ect , so much the better , but my k@@ ey point here is that we &apos;re going to have to work on each of these five , and we can &apos;t give up any of them because they look da@@ un@@ ting , because they all have sig@@ ni@@ f@@ ic@@ ant ch@@ all@@ en@@ ges .
L@@ et &apos;s look first at the b@@ ur@@ ning f@@ os@@ si@@ l fu@@ els , ei@@ ther b@@ ur@@ ning co@@ al or b@@ ur@@ ning nat@@ ur@@ al g@@ as .
What you need to do there , se@@ em@@ s like it might be sim@@ ple , but it &apos;s not , and that &apos;s to take all the C@@ O@@ 2 , after you &apos;ve b@@ ur@@ ned it , going out the f@@ lu@@ e , pres@@ su@@ ri@@ ze it , create a li@@ qu@@ id , put it some@@ where , and hop@@ e it sta@@ ys there .
Now we have some p@@ il@@ ot things that do this at the 6@@ 0 to 8@@ 0 percent le@@ v@@ el , but getting up to that f@@ ul@@ l perc@@ ent@@ age , that will be very tri@@ ck@@ y , and ag@@ re@@ eing on where these C@@ O@@ 2 qu@@ an@@ ti@@ ties should be put will be har@@ d , but the t@@ ou@@ gh@@ est one here is this l@@ on@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m is@@ su@@ e .
Wh@@ o &apos;s going to be s@@ ure ?
Wh@@ o &apos;s going to gu@@ ar@@ an@@ te@@ e something that is li@@ ter@@ ally b@@ illi@@ ons of times lar@@ ger than any t@@ yp@@ e of wa@@ ste you think of in ter@@ ms of n@@ u@@ cle@@ ar or other things ?
This is a lot of vol@@ u@@ me .
So that &apos;s a t@@ ough one .
N@@ ex@@ t would be n@@ u@@ cle@@ ar .
It also has three big proble@@ ms : C@@ ost , partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly in high@@ ly re@@ g@@ ul@@ ated coun@@ tri@@ es , is hi@@ gh ; the is@@ su@@ e of the sa@@ f@@ et@@ y , really fe@@ el@@ ing good about no@@ thing could go w@@ r@@ ong , that , even th@@ ough you have these human op@@ er@@ at@@ ors , that the fu@@ el doesn &apos;t get used for we@@ ap@@ ons .
And then what do you do with the wa@@ ste ?
And , al@@ th@@ ough it &apos;s not very lar@@ ge , there are a lot of con@@ cer@@ ns about that .
P@@ e@@ ople need to feel good about it .
So three very t@@ ough proble@@ ms that might be sol@@ v@@ able , and so , should be wor@@ ked on .
The last three of the five , I &apos;ve grou@@ p@@ ed together .
These are what people o@@ ften re@@ f@@ er to as the r@@ en@@ e@@ w@@ able s@@ our@@ ces .
And they actually -- al@@ th@@ ough it &apos;s great they don &apos;t re@@ qu@@ ir@@ e fu@@ el -- they have some dis@@ ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ges .
One is that the den@@ s@@ ity of energy ga@@ ther@@ ed in these te@@ chn@@ ologi@@ es is dra@@ ma@@ tic@@ ally less than a power pl@@ ant .
This is energy f@@ ar@@ m@@ ing , so you &apos;re talking about many s@@ qu@@ are m@@ il@@ es , thou@@ s@@ and@@ s of time more are@@ a than you think of as a nor@@ mal energy pl@@ ant .
Also , these are inter@@ mit@@ t@@ ent s@@ our@@ ces .
The su@@ n doesn &apos;t sh@@ ine all day , it doesn &apos;t sh@@ ine every day , and , li@@ ke@@ wis@@ e , the w@@ ind doesn &apos;t b@@ low all the time .
And so , if you de@@ p@@ end on these s@@ our@@ ces , you have to have some way of getting the energy dur@@ ing those time per@@ i@@ o@@ ds that it &apos;s not av@@ a@@ il@@ able .
So , we &apos;ve got big c@@ ost ch@@ all@@ en@@ ges here , we have trans@@ mis@@ sion ch@@ all@@ en@@ ges : for example , say this energy s@@ our@@ ce is out@@ side your country ; you not only need the technology , but you have to de@@ al with the ris@@ k of the energy coming from el@@ se@@ where .
And , fin@@ ally , this stor@@ age problem .
And , to di@@ men@@ si@@ on@@ ali@@ ze this , I went through and loo@@ ked at all the t@@ yp@@ es of b@@ at@@ ter@@ ies that get made -- for c@@ ars , for compu@@ ters , for ph@@ ones , for fl@@ as@@ h@@ li@@ gh@@ ts , for everything -- and com@@ par@@ ed that to the am@@ o@@ un@@ t of elec@@ tri@@ cal energy the world us@@ es , and what I found is that all the b@@ at@@ ter@@ ies we make now could st@@ ore less than 10 min@@ utes of all the energy .
And so , in fact , we need a big bre@@ ak@@ through here , something that &apos;s going to be a fac@@ tor of 100 better than the ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ es we have now .
It &apos;s not im@@ possible , but it &apos;s not a very eas@@ y thing .
Now , this sho@@ ws up when you try to get the inter@@ mit@@ t@@ ent s@@ our@@ ce to be ab@@ o@@ ve , say , 20 to 30 percent of what you &apos;re using .
If you &apos;re coun@@ ting on it for 100 percent , you need an incre@@ di@@ ble mi@@ ra@@ c@@ le b@@ at@@ ter@@ y .
Now , how we &apos;re going to go for@@ ward on this -- what &apos;s the right ap@@ pro@@ ach ?
I@@ s it a M@@ an@@ hat@@ t@@ an Pro@@ ject ? What &apos;s the thing that can get us there ?
Well , we need l@@ ots of comp@@ an@@ ies working on this , h@@ und@@ re@@ ds .
In each of these five pa@@ ths , we need at le@@ ast a h@@ und@@ red people .
And a lot of them , you &apos;ll look at and say , &quot; They &apos;re cra@@ z@@ y . &quot; That &apos;s good .
And , I think , here in the TED grou@@ p , we have many people who are al@@ ready p@@ ur@@ su@@ ing this .
Bil@@ l Gr@@ os@@ s has se@@ ver@@ al comp@@ an@@ ies , inc@@ lu@@ ding one called e@@ S@@ ol@@ ar that has some great sol@@ ar ther@@ mal te@@ chn@@ ologi@@ es .
V@@ in@@ od K@@ h@@ os@@ l@@ a &apos;s inv@@ es@@ ting in do@@ z@@ ens of comp@@ an@@ ies that are doing great things and have interesting possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ties , and I &apos;m trying to help back that .
N@@ a@@ than M@@ y@@ hr@@ v@@ old and I actually are b@@ ac@@ king a comp@@ any that , per@@ h@@ ap@@ s sur@@ pr@@ is@@ ing@@ ly , is actually ta@@ king the n@@ u@@ cle@@ ar ap@@ pro@@ ach .
There are some in@@ nov@@ ations in n@@ u@@ cle@@ ar : mo@@ d@@ ular , li@@ qu@@ id .
And in@@ nov@@ ation really st@@ op@@ p@@ ed in this in@@ du@@ str@@ y quite some ago , so the idea that there &apos;s some good ideas la@@ ying around is not all that sur@@ pr@@ is@@ ing .
The idea of T@@ er@@ ra@@ Po@@ wer is that , in@@ ste@@ ad of b@@ ur@@ ning a part of ur@@ ani@@ um -- the one percent , which is the U@@ 2@@ 3@@ 5 -- we de@@ ci@@ ded , &quot; L@@ et &apos;s b@@ ur@@ n the 9@@ 9 percent , the U@@ 2@@ 3@@ 8 . &quot;
It is kind of a cra@@ z@@ y idea .
In fact , people had tal@@ ked about it for a long time , but they could never sim@@ ul@@ ate pro@@ per@@ ly wh@@ e@@ ther it would work or not , and so it &apos;s through the ad@@ v@@ ent of mo@@ dern su@@ per@@ compu@@ ters that now you can sim@@ ul@@ ate and see that , y@@ es , with the right mat@@ eri@@ al &apos;s ap@@ pro@@ ach , this loo@@ ks like it would work .
And , because you &apos;re b@@ ur@@ ning that 9@@ 9 percent , you have gre@@ at@@ ly im@@ pro@@ ved c@@ ost pro@@ fi@@ le .
You actually b@@ ur@@ n up the wa@@ ste , and you can actually use as fu@@ el all the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver wa@@ ste from today &apos;s re@@ ac@@ t@@ ors .
So , in@@ ste@@ ad of wor@@ r@@ ying about them , you just take that . It &apos;s a great thing .
It bre@@ a@@ th@@ es this ur@@ ani@@ um as it go@@ es al@@ ong , so it &apos;s kind of like a c@@ and@@ le .
You can see it &apos;s a lo@@ g there , o@@ ften re@@ fer@@ red to as a tra@@ vel@@ ing wa@@ ve re@@ ac@@ tor .
In ter@@ ms of fu@@ el , this really sol@@ ves the problem .
I &apos;ve got a pic@@ ture here of a place in K@@ ent@@ u@@ ck@@ y .
This is the le@@ f@@ to@@ ver , the 9@@ 9 percent , where they &apos;ve ta@@ ken out the part they b@@ ur@@ n now , so it &apos;s called de@@ ple@@ ted ur@@ ani@@ um .
That would power the U@@ .@@ S@@ . for h@@ und@@ re@@ ds of years .
And , sim@@ p@@ ly by fil@@ ter@@ ing se@@ a@@ water in an in@@ exp@@ ensi@@ ve pro@@ cess , you &apos;d have enough fu@@ el for the enti@@ re li@@ fe@@ time of the res@@ t of the planet .
So , you know , it &apos;s got l@@ ots of ch@@ all@@ en@@ ges ah@@ e@@ ad , but it is an example of the many h@@ und@@ re@@ ds and h@@ und@@ re@@ ds of ideas that we need to mo@@ ve for@@ ward .
So let &apos;s think : How should we me@@ as@@ ure our@@ selves ?
What should our re@@ p@@ ort car@@ d look like ?
Well , let &apos;s go out to where we really need to get , and then look at the inter@@ medi@@ ate .
F@@ or 20@@ 50 , you &apos;ve hear@@ d many people talk about this 8@@ 0 percent re@@ duc@@ tion .
That really is very important , that we get there .
And that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in po@@ or coun@@ tri@@ es , still some ag@@ ri@@ cul@@ ture , hop@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly we will have cle@@ an@@ ed up for@@ es@@ try , c@@ em@@ ent .
So , to get to that 8@@ 0 percent , the develop@@ ed coun@@ tri@@ es , inc@@ lu@@ ding coun@@ tri@@ es like Chin@@ a , will have had to s@@ wi@@ t@@ ch their elec@@ tri@@ city gener@@ ation al@@ together .
So , the other gra@@ de is : A@@ re we de@@ p@@ lo@@ ying this z@@ er@@ o@@ -@@ em@@ is@@ sion technology , have we de@@ p@@ lo@@ y@@ ed it in all the develop@@ ed coun@@ tri@@ es and we &apos;re in the pro@@ cess of getting it el@@ se@@ where ?
That &apos;s su@@ per important .
That &apos;s a k@@ ey el@@ em@@ ent of making that re@@ p@@ ort car@@ d .
So , b@@ ac@@ king up from there , what should the 20@@ 20 re@@ p@@ ort car@@ d look like ?
Well , again , it should have the two el@@ em@@ ents .
We should go through these eff@@ ic@@ i@@ en@@ cy me@@ as@@ ur@@ es to start getting re@@ duc@@ tions : The less we em@@ it , the less that s@@ um will be of C@@ O@@ 2 , and , ther@@ e@@ fore , the less the tem@@ per@@ at@@ ure .
But in some ways , the gra@@ de we get there , doing things that don &apos;t get us all the way to the big re@@ duc@@ tions , is only e@@ qu@@ ally , or maybe even s@@ li@@ gh@@ tly less , important than the other , which is the piec@@ e of in@@ nov@@ ation on these bre@@ ak@@ thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ s .
These bre@@ ak@@ thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ s , we need to mo@@ ve those at f@@ ul@@ l spe@@ ed , and we can me@@ as@@ ure that in ter@@ ms of comp@@ an@@ ies , p@@ il@@ ot pro@@ j@@ ects , re@@ g@@ ul@@ at@@ ory things that have been chan@@ g@@ ed .
There &apos;s a lot of great bo@@ o@@ ks that have been w@@ rit@@ ten about this .
The A@@ l G@@ ore book , &quot; O@@ ur C@@ ho@@ ice &quot; and the D@@ avi@@ d M@@ c@@ K@@ ay book , &quot; Su@@ sta@@ in@@ able En@@ erg@@ y Wi@@ th@@ out the H@@ ot A@@ ir . &quot;
They really go through it and create a fra@@ me@@ work that this can be dis@@ c@@ us@@ s@@ ed bro@@ ad@@ ly , because we need bro@@ ad b@@ ac@@ king for this .
There &apos;s a lot that has to come together .
So this is a wis@@ h .
It &apos;s a very con@@ cre@@ te wis@@ h that we inv@@ ent this technology .
If you ga@@ ve me only one wis@@ h for the next 50 years -- I could pic@@ k who &apos;s pres@@ i@@ d@@ ent , I could pic@@ k a v@@ ac@@ c@@ ine , which is something I love , or I could pic@@ k that this thing that &apos;s hal@@ f the c@@ ost with no C@@ O@@ 2 ge@@ ts inv@@ ent@@ ed -- this is the wis@@ h I would pic@@ k .
This is the one with the gre@@ at@@ est imp@@ act .
If we don &apos;t get this wis@@ h , the di@@ v@@ isi@@ on between the people who think sh@@ ort ter@@ m and long ter@@ m will be ter@@ ri@@ ble , between the U@@ .@@ S@@ . and Chin@@ a , between po@@ or coun@@ tri@@ es and r@@ ich , and most of all the li@@ ves of those two b@@ illion will be f@@ ar wor@@ se .
So , what do we have to do ?
What am I ap@@ pe@@ al@@ ing to you to ste@@ p for@@ ward and dri@@ ve ?
We need to go for more res@@ ear@@ ch f@@ und@@ ing .
When coun@@ tri@@ es get together in plac@@ es like C@@ op@@ en@@ ha@@ gen , they sh@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t just dis@@ c@@ us@@ s the C@@ O@@ 2 .
They should dis@@ c@@ us@@ s this in@@ nov@@ ation a@@ gen@@ da , and you &apos;d be st@@ un@@ ned at the ri@@ di@@ cul@@ ous@@ ly low le@@ vel@@ s of sp@@ en@@ ding on these in@@ nov@@ ative ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ es .
We do need the mark@@ et inc@@ enti@@ ves -- C@@ O@@ 2 ta@@ x , c@@ a@@ p and tra@@ de -- something that ge@@ ts that pri@@ ce sig@@ n@@ al out there .
We need to get the m@@ es@@ sage out .
We need to have this di@@ al@@ og@@ ue be a more ra@@ tional , more under@@ stand@@ able di@@ al@@ og@@ ue , inc@@ lu@@ ding the st@@ ep@@ s that the go@@ vern@@ ment ta@@ kes .
This is an important wis@@ h , but it is one I think we can ach@@ ie@@ ve .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Chr@@ is An@@ der@@ son : Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you . So to understand more about T@@ er@@ ra@@ Po@@ wer , right -- I mean , first of all , can you give a sense of what sc@@ ale of inv@@ est@@ ment this is ?
B@@ il G@@ ates : T@@ o actually do the so@@ ft@@ w@@ are , bu@@ y the su@@ per@@ compu@@ ter , hi@@ re all the great sci@@ enti@@ st@@ s , which we &apos;ve done , that &apos;s only ten@@ s of m@@ illi@@ ons , and even on@@ ce we t@@ est our mat@@ eri@@ als out in a R@@ us@@ si@@ an re@@ ac@@ tor to make s@@ ure that our mat@@ eri@@ als work pro@@ per@@ ly , then you &apos;ll only be up in the h@@ und@@ re@@ ds of m@@ illi@@ ons .
The t@@ ough thing is building the p@@ il@@ ot re@@ ac@@ tor ; fin@@ ding the se@@ ver@@ al b@@ illion , fin@@ ding the re@@ g@@ ul@@ at@@ or , the lo@@ c@@ ation that will actually bu@@ ild the first one of these .
O@@ n@@ ce you get the first one buil@@ t , if it wor@@ ks as ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ s@@ ed , then it &apos;s just cle@@ ar as day , because the econom@@ ic@@ s , the energy den@@ s@@ ity , are so different than n@@ u@@ cle@@ ar as we know it .
C@@ A : And so , to understand it right , this in@@ vol@@ ves building de@@ ep into the gro@@ und al@@ most like a ver@@ tical kind of col@@ um@@ n of n@@ u@@ cle@@ ar fu@@ el , of this sort of sp@@ ent ur@@ ani@@ um , and then the pro@@ cess star@@ ts at the top and kind of wor@@ ks down ?
B@@ G : That &apos;s right . To@@ day , you &apos;re always re@@ fu@@ el@@ ing the re@@ ac@@ tor , so you have l@@ ots of people and l@@ ots of con@@ tro@@ l@@ s that can go w@@ r@@ ong : that thing where you &apos;re op@@ en@@ ing it up and mo@@ ving things in and out , that &apos;s not good .
So , if you have very ch@@ e@@ a@@ p fu@@ el that you can put 6@@ 0 years in -- just think of it as a lo@@ g -- put it down and not have those same comp@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ties .
And it just s@@ its there and b@@ ur@@ ns for the 6@@ 0 years , and then it &apos;s done .
C@@ A : It &apos;s a n@@ u@@ cle@@ ar power pl@@ ant that is its own wa@@ ste dis@@ pos@@ al sol@@ ution .
B@@ G : Y@@ e@@ ah . Well , what happ@@ ens with the wa@@ ste , you can let it s@@ it there -- there &apos;s a lot less wa@@ ste un@@ der this ap@@ pro@@ ach -- then you can actually take that , and put it into another one and b@@ ur@@ n that .
And we start off actually by ta@@ king the wa@@ ste that ex@@ is@@ ts today , that &apos;s sit@@ ting in these co@@ ol@@ ing po@@ ol@@ s or dr@@ y c@@ as@@ king by re@@ ac@@ t@@ ors -- that &apos;s our fu@@ el to beg@@ in with .
So , the thing that &apos;s been a problem from those re@@ ac@@ t@@ ors is actually what ge@@ ts f@@ ed into our@@ s , and you &apos;re re@@ duc@@ ing the vol@@ u@@ me of the wa@@ ste quite dra@@ ma@@ tic@@ ally as you &apos;re going through this pro@@ cess .
C@@ A : I mean , you &apos;re talking to different people around the world about the possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ties here .
W@@ here is there most inter@@ est in actually doing something with this ?
B@@ G : Well , we ha@@ ven &apos;t pi@@ ck@@ ed a partic@@ ular place , and there &apos;s all these interesting dis@@ cl@@ os@@ ure r@@ ul@@ es about anything that &apos;s called &quot; n@@ u@@ cle@@ ar , &quot; so we &apos;ve got a lot of inter@@ est , that people from the comp@@ any have been in R@@ us@@ si@@ a , Indi@@ a , Chin@@ a -- I &apos;ve been back se@@ eing the s@@ ec@@ re@@ t@@ ary of energy here , talking about how this f@@ its into the energy a@@ gen@@ da .
So I &apos;m op@@ tim@@ is@@ tic . You know , the Fr@@ en@@ ch and J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese have done some work .
This is a v@@ ari@@ ant on something that has been done .
It &apos;s an important ad@@ v@@ ance , but it &apos;s like a fast re@@ ac@@ tor , and a lot of coun@@ tri@@ es have buil@@ t them , so any@@ body who &apos;s done a fast re@@ ac@@ tor is a can@@ di@@ da@@ te to be where the first one ge@@ ts buil@@ t .
C@@ A : So , in your m@@ ind , tim@@ es@@ c@@ ale and li@@ ke@@ li@@ ho@@ od of actually ta@@ king something like this live ?
B@@ G : Well , we need -- for one of these high@@ -@@ sc@@ ale , elec@@ tro@@ -@@ gener@@ ation things that &apos;s very ch@@ e@@ a@@ p , we have 20 years to inv@@ ent and then 20 years to de@@ p@@ lo@@ y .
That &apos;s sort of the de@@ ad@@ line that the en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment@@ al mo@@ d@@ els have sho@@ wn us that we have to me@@ et .
And , you know , T@@ er@@ ra@@ Po@@ wer , if things go well -- which is wis@@ h@@ ing for a lot -- could eas@@ ily me@@ et that .
And there are , for@@ t@@ un@@ at@@ ely now , do@@ z@@ ens of comp@@ an@@ ies -- we need it to be h@@ und@@ re@@ ds -- who , li@@ ke@@ wis@@ e , if their sci@@ ence go@@ es well , if the f@@ und@@ ing for their p@@ il@@ ot plan@@ ts go@@ es well , that they can com@@ pe@@ te for this .
And it &apos;s best if m@@ ul@@ ti@@ ple su@@ c@@ ce@@ ed , because then you could use a mi@@ x of these things .
We cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly need one to su@@ c@@ ce@@ ed .
C@@ A : In ter@@ ms of b@@ ig@@ -@@ sc@@ ale possible g@@ ame chan@@ ges , is this the b@@ ig@@ ges@@ t that you &apos;re a@@ w@@ are of out there ?
B@@ G : A@@ n energy bre@@ ak@@ through is the most important thing .
It would have been , even with@@ out the en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment@@ al con@@ stra@@ int , but the en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment@@ al con@@ stra@@ int just ma@@ kes it so much gre@@ ater .
In the n@@ u@@ cle@@ ar space , there are other in@@ nov@@ at@@ ors .
You know , we don &apos;t know their work as well as we know this one , but the mo@@ d@@ ular people , that &apos;s a different ap@@ pro@@ ach .
There &apos;s a li@@ qui@@ d@@ -@@ t@@ yp@@ e re@@ ac@@ tor , which se@@ em@@ s a little har@@ d , but maybe they say that about us .
And so , there are different ones , but the beau@@ ty of this is a m@@ ol@@ ec@@ u@@ le of ur@@ ani@@ um has a million times as much energy as a m@@ ol@@ ec@@ u@@ le of , say , co@@ al , and so -- if you can de@@ al with the ne@@ g@@ ati@@ ves , which are ess@@ enti@@ ally the ra@@ di@@ ation -- the fo@@ ot@@ pr@@ int and c@@ ost , the p@@ ot@@ enti@@ al , in ter@@ ms of eff@@ ect on land and v@@ ari@@ ous things , is al@@ most in a cl@@ ass of its own .
C@@ A : If this doesn &apos;t work , then what ?
D@@ o we have to start ta@@ king em@@ er@@ gen@@ cy me@@ as@@ ur@@ es to try and ke@@ ep the tem@@ per@@ at@@ ure of the ear@@ th st@@ able ?
B@@ G : If you get into that sit@@ u@@ ation , it &apos;s like if you &apos;ve been o@@ ver@@ -@@ e@@ ating , and you &apos;re about to have a hear@@ t att@@ ack : Th@@ en where do you go ? You may need hear@@ t sur@@ ger@@ y or something .
There is a line of res@@ ear@@ ch on what &apos;s called ge@@ o@@ eng@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ing , which are v@@ ari@@ ous te@@ chni@@ qu@@ es that would d@@ el@@ ay the he@@ ating to bu@@ y us 20 or 30 years to get our act together .
Now , that &apos;s just an in@@ sur@@ ance po@@ lic@@ y .
You hop@@ e you don &apos;t need to do that .
S@@ ome people say you sh@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t even work on the in@@ sur@@ ance po@@ lic@@ y because it might make you la@@ z@@ y , that you &apos;ll ke@@ ep e@@ ating because you know hear@@ t sur@@ ger@@ y will be there to sa@@ ve you .
I &apos;m not s@@ ure that &apos;s wis@@ e , gi@@ ven the import@@ ance of the problem , but there &apos;s now the ge@@ o@@ eng@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ing dis@@ c@@ us@@ sion about -- should that be in the back po@@ ck@@ et in c@@ ase things happ@@ en fa@@ ster , or this in@@ nov@@ ation go@@ es a lot s@@ lo@@ wer than we exp@@ ect ?
C@@ A : C@@ li@@ ma@@ te sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ s : If you had a s@@ ent@@ ence or two to say to them , how might you per@@ su@@ ade them that they &apos;re w@@ r@@ ong ?
B@@ G : Well , un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ at@@ ely , the sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ s come in different c@@ am@@ ps .
The ones who make sci@@ enti@@ fi@@ c ar@@ g@@ um@@ ents are very few .
A@@ re they sa@@ ying that there &apos;s ne@@ g@@ ative fe@@ e@@ d@@ back eff@@ ects that have to do with cl@@ ou@@ ds that off@@ set things ?
There are very , very few things that they can even say there &apos;s a chan@@ ce in a million of those things .
The ma@@ in problem we have here , it &apos;s kind of like A@@ I@@ D@@ S .
You make the mis@@ take now , and you p@@ ay for it a lot l@@ ater .
And so , when you have all sor@@ ts of ur@@ g@@ ent proble@@ ms , the idea of ta@@ king pa@@ in now that has to do with a ga@@ in l@@ ater , and a some@@ what un@@ cer@@ tain pa@@ in thing -- in fact , the I@@ P@@ C@@ C re@@ p@@ ort , that &apos;s not nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly the wor@@ st c@@ ase , and there are people in the r@@ ich world who look at I@@ P@@ C@@ C and say , &quot; OK , that is@@ n &apos;t that big of a de@@ al . &quot;
The fact is it &apos;s that un@@ cer@@ tain part that should mo@@ ve us to@@ war@@ ds this .
But my dre@@ am here is that , if you can make it econom@@ ic , and me@@ et the C@@ O@@ 2 con@@ stra@@ in@@ ts , then the sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ s say , &quot; OK , I don &apos;t c@@ are that it doesn &apos;t put out C@@ O@@ 2 , I kind of wis@@ h it did put out C@@ O@@ 2 , but I gu@@ ess I &apos;ll ac@@ ce@@ pt it because it &apos;s ch@@ e@@ ap@@ er than what &apos;s come before . &quot;
C@@ A : And so , that would be your res@@ pon@@ se to the B@@ j@@ or@@ n L@@ om@@ bor@@ g ar@@ g@@ um@@ ent , that bas@@ ically if you sp@@ end all this energy trying to sol@@ ve the C@@ O@@ 2 problem , it &apos;s going to take away all your other go@@ als of trying to ri@@ d the world of po@@ ver@@ ty and m@@ al@@ ari@@ a and so for@@ th , it &apos;s a stu@@ p@@ id wa@@ ste of the Earth &apos;s res@@ our@@ ces to put money to@@ war@@ ds that when there are better things we can do .
B@@ G : Well , the ac@@ tu@@ al sp@@ en@@ ding on the R &@@ am@@ p@@ ; am@@ p ; D piec@@ e -- say the U@@ .@@ S@@ . should sp@@ end 10 b@@ illion a year more than it is right now -- it &apos;s not that dra@@ ma@@ tic .
It sh@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t take away from other things .
The thing you get into big money on , and this , reas@@ on@@ able people can dis@@ ag@@ ree , is when you have something that &apos;s n@@ on@@ -@@ econom@@ ic and you &apos;re trying to f@@ und that -- that , to me , mos@@ tly is a wa@@ ste .
Un@@ less you &apos;re very cl@@ ose and you &apos;re just f@@ und@@ ing the lear@@ ning cur@@ ve and it &apos;s going to get very ch@@ e@@ a@@ p , I believe we should try more things that have a p@@ ot@@ enti@@ al to be f@@ ar less exp@@ ensi@@ ve .
If the tra@@ de@@ -@@ off you get into is , &quot; L@@ et &apos;s make energy su@@ per exp@@ ensi@@ ve , &quot; then the r@@ ich can aff@@ or@@ d that .
I mean , all of us here could p@@ ay five times as much for our energy and not change our li@@ f@@ est@@ y@@ le .
The dis@@ a@@ ster is for that two b@@ illion .
And even L@@ om@@ bor@@ g has chan@@ g@@ ed .
H@@ is sh@@ ti@@ ck now is , &quot; Wh@@ y is@@ n &apos;t the R &@@ am@@ p@@ ; am@@ p ; D getting more dis@@ c@@ us@@ s@@ ed ? &quot;
He &apos;s still , because of his ear@@ li@@ er stuff , still as@@ soci@@ ated with the sk@@ ep@@ tic c@@ am@@ p , but he &apos;s re@@ ali@@ zed that &apos;s a pretty l@@ on@@ ely c@@ am@@ p , and so , he &apos;s making the R &@@ am@@ p@@ ; am@@ p ; D point .
And so there is a th@@ re@@ ad of something that I think is ap@@ pro@@ pri@@ ate .
The R &@@ am@@ p@@ ; am@@ p ; D piec@@ e , it &apos;s cra@@ z@@ y how little it &apos;s f@@ und@@ ed .
C@@ A : Well Bil@@ l , I s@@ us@@ p@@ ect I spe@@ ak on the beh@@ al@@ f of most people here to say I really hop@@ e your wis@@ h comes tr@@ ue . Thank you so much .
B@@ G : Thank you .
I &apos;d like to sh@@ are with you a dis@@ co@@ very that I made a few mon@@ ths ago whi@@ le w@@ ri@@ ting an ar@@ tic@@ le for I@@ tal@@ i@@ an Wi@@ red .
I always ke@@ ep my th@@ es@@ au@@ r@@ us hand@@ y wh@@ en@@ ever I &apos;m w@@ ri@@ ting anything , but I &apos;d al@@ ready fin@@ is@@ h@@ ed e@@ di@@ ting the piec@@ e , and I re@@ ali@@ zed that I had never on@@ ce in my life loo@@ ked up the wor@@ d &quot; dis@@ ab@@ l@@ ed &quot; to see what I &apos;d find .
L@@ et me re@@ ad you the ent@@ ry .
&quot; D@@ is@@ ab@@ l@@ ed , ad@@ j@@ ec@@ tive : cri@@ p@@ pl@@ ed , hel@@ pl@@ ess , us@@ el@@ ess , w@@ re@@ ck@@ ed , st@@ all@@ ed , ma@@ im@@ ed , wo@@ und@@ ed , man@@ gl@@ ed , l@@ ame , m@@ u@@ ti@@ l@@ ated , r@@ un@@ -@@ down , wor@@ n@@ -@@ out , we@@ ak@@ en@@ ed , imp@@ ot@@ ent , c@@ a@@ str@@ ated , par@@ al@@ y@@ zed , h@@ an@@ dic@@ app@@ ed , sen@@ i@@ le , de@@ cre@@ p@@ it , la@@ i@@ d@@ -@@ up , d@@ on@@ e-@@ up , d@@ on@@ e-@@ for , d@@ on@@ e-@@ in cra@@ ck@@ e@@ d@@ -@@ up , coun@@ te@@ d@@ -@@ out ; see also h@@ ur@@ t , us@@ el@@ ess and we@@ ak .
Ant@@ on@@ y@@ ms , heal@@ th@@ y , str@@ ong , cap@@ able . &quot;
I was read@@ ing this li@@ st out l@@ ou@@ d to a fri@@ end and at first was lau@@ gh@@ ing , it was so lu@@ dic@@ r@@ ous , but I &apos;d just g@@ ot@@ ten p@@ ast &quot; man@@ gl@@ ed , &quot; and my v@@ o@@ ice bro@@ ke , and I had to sto@@ p and col@@ lec@@ t my@@ self from the em@@ o@@ tional sho@@ ck and imp@@ act that the ass@@ au@@ lt from these wor@@ ds un@@ le@@ as@@ h@@ ed .
You know , of course , this is my ra@@ g@@ ge@@ dy old th@@ es@@ au@@ r@@ us so I &apos;m thinking this m@@ ust be an an@@ ci@@ ent pr@@ int da@@ te , right ?
But , in fact , the pr@@ int da@@ te was the ear@@ ly 19@@ 8@@ 0@@ s , when I would have been star@@ ting pri@@ mar@@ y school and for@@ m@@ ing an under@@ stand@@ ing of my@@ self out@@ side the fam@@ ily un@@ it and as rel@@ ated to the other kids and the world around me .
And , nee@@ d@@ less to say , th@@ ank G@@ od I w@@ as@@ n &apos;t using a th@@ es@@ au@@ r@@ us back then .
I mean , from this ent@@ ry , it would se@@ em that I was bor@@ n into a world that perc@@ ei@@ ved some@@ one like me to have no@@ thing posi@@ tive wh@@ at@@ so@@ ever going for them , when in fact , today I &apos;m c@@ el@@ e@@ br@@ ated for the op@@ port@@ uni@@ ties and ad@@ v@@ ent@@ ur@@ es my life has pro@@ c@@ u@@ red .
So , I im@@ medi@@ at@@ ely went to look up the 200@@ 9 on@@ line e@@ di@@ tion , exp@@ ec@@ ting to find a re@@ v@@ isi@@ on wor@@ th n@@ ot@@ ing .
Here &apos;s the up@@ d@@ ated ver@@ sion of this ent@@ ry .
Un@@ for@@ t@@ un@@ at@@ ely , it &apos;s not much better .
I find the last two wor@@ ds un@@ der &quot; Ne@@ ar Ant@@ on@@ y@@ ms , &quot; partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly uns@@ et@@ t@@ l@@ ing : &quot; whole &quot; and &quot; wh@@ ol@@ es@@ ome . &quot;
So , it &apos;s not just about the wor@@ ds .
It &apos;s what we believe about people when we n@@ ame them with these wor@@ ds .
It &apos;s about the val@@ u@@ es beh@@ ind the wor@@ ds , and how we con@@ struc@@ t those val@@ u@@ es .
O@@ ur lan@@ gu@@ age aff@@ ects our thinking and how we vie@@ w the world and how we vie@@ w other people .
In fact , many an@@ ci@@ ent soci@@ e@@ ties , inc@@ lu@@ ding the G@@ re@@ e@@ ks and the R@@ om@@ ans , be@@ li@@ ev@@ ed that to ut@@ ter a cur@@ se ver@@ b@@ ally was so po@@ wer@@ ful , because to say the thing out l@@ ou@@ d br@@ ou@@ ght it into ex@@ ist@@ ence .
So , what re@@ ality do we want to call into ex@@ ist@@ ence : a person who is li@@ mit@@ ed , or a person who &apos;s em@@ po@@ wer@@ ed ?
B@@ y c@@ as@@ u@@ ally doing something as sim@@ ple as nam@@ ing a person , a ch@@ ild , we might be p@@ ut@@ ting li@@ ds and c@@ ast@@ ing s@@ ha@@ do@@ ws on their power .
W@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t we want to op@@ en do@@ ors for them in@@ ste@@ ad ?
One such person who op@@ en@@ ed do@@ ors for me was my chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od do@@ c@@ tor at the A@@ .@@ I@@ . du@@ P@@ on@@ t In@@ sti@@ tu@@ te in W@@ il@@ m@@ ing@@ ton , D@@ el@@ a@@ w@@ are .
H@@ is n@@ ame was D@@ r@@ . P@@ i@@ z@@ zu@@ ti@@ ll@@ o , an I@@ tal@@ i@@ an Ameri@@ can , wh@@ ose n@@ ame , ap@@ par@@ ent@@ ly , was too diff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t for most A@@ mer@@ ic@@ ans to pr@@ on@@ o@@ un@@ ce , so he went by D@@ r@@ . P .
And D@@ r@@ . P always wor@@ e really col@@ or@@ ful b@@ ow ties and had the very per@@ f@@ ect dis@@ posi@@ tion to work with children .
I lo@@ ved al@@ most everything about my time sp@@ ent at this h@@ os@@ p@@ ital , with the ex@@ c@@ ep@@ tion of my physi@@ cal ther@@ ap@@ y s@@ es@@ si@@ ons .
I had to do what se@@ em@@ ed like inn@@ um@@ er@@ able re@@ pe@@ ti@@ tions of ex@@ er@@ c@@ is@@ es with these th@@ ic@@ k , el@@ as@@ tic b@@ and@@ s -- different col@@ ors , you know -- to help bu@@ ild up my le@@ g mus@@ c@@ les , and I hat@@ ed these b@@ and@@ s more than anything -- I hat@@ ed them , had nam@@ es for them . I hat@@ ed them .
And , you know , I was al@@ ready bar@@ ga@@ in@@ ing , as a five year@@ -@@ old ch@@ ild , with D@@ r@@ . P to try to get out of doing these ex@@ er@@ c@@ is@@ es , un@@ su@@ c@@ c@@ ess@@ f@@ ul@@ ly , of course .
And , one day , he came in to my s@@ es@@ sion -- ex@@ h@@ aus@@ tive and un@@ for@@ gi@@ ving , these s@@ es@@ si@@ ons -- and he said to me , &quot; W@@ ow . A@@ im@@ e@@ e , you are such a str@@ ong and po@@ wer@@ ful little gi@@ r@@ l , I think you &apos;re going to bre@@ ak one of those b@@ and@@ s .
When you do bre@@ ak it , I &apos;m going to give you a h@@ und@@ red bu@@ cks . &quot;
Now , of course , this was a sim@@ ple p@@ lo@@ y on D@@ r@@ . P &apos;s part to get me to do the ex@@ er@@ c@@ is@@ es I didn &apos;t want to do before the pr@@ os@@ p@@ ect of being the ri@@ ch@@ est fi@@ v@@ e-@@ year@@ -@@ old in the second flo@@ or ward , but what he eff@@ ec@@ tiv@@ ely did for me was res@@ h@@ ap@@ e an a@@ w@@ ful da@@ ily o@@ c@@ cur@@ r@@ ence into a new and pro@@ mis@@ ing experi@@ ence for me .
And I have to w@@ on@@ der today to what ex@@ t@@ ent his v@@ isi@@ on and his de@@ cl@@ ar@@ ation of me as a str@@ ong and po@@ wer@@ ful little gi@@ r@@ l sh@@ ap@@ ed my own vie@@ w of my@@ self as an in@@ her@@ ent@@ ly str@@ ong , po@@ wer@@ ful and a@@ th@@ le@@ tic person well into the future .
This is an example of how ad@@ ul@@ ts in posi@@ tions of power can ig@@ ni@@ te the power of a ch@@ ild .
But , in the pre@@ vi@@ ous in@@ st@@ an@@ ces of those th@@ es@@ au@@ r@@ us ent@@ ri@@ es , our lan@@ gu@@ age is@@ n &apos;t al@@ lo@@ wing us to evol@@ ve into the re@@ ality that we would all want , the possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ty of an in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al to see the@@ m@@ selves as cap@@ able .
O@@ ur lan@@ gu@@ age h@@ as@@ n &apos;t c@@ au@@ ght up with the chan@@ ges in our soci@@ et@@ y , many of which have been br@@ ou@@ ght about by technology .
C@@ er@@ ta@@ in@@ ly , from a medi@@ cal stand@@ point , my le@@ gs , l@@ as@@ er sur@@ ger@@ y for v@@ isi@@ on im@@ pa@@ ir@@ ment , tit@@ ani@@ um k@@ ne@@ es and hi@@ p re@@ plac@@ em@@ ents for ag@@ ing bo@@ dies that are al@@ lo@@ wing people to more f@@ ul@@ ly eng@@ age with their abili@@ ties , and mo@@ ve be@@ y@@ on@@ d the li@@ mit@@ s that nat@@ ure has im@@ pos@@ ed on them -- not to men@@ tion soci@@ al net@@ working pl@@ at@@ for@@ ms al@@ low people to sel@@ f@@ -@@ i@@ den@@ ti@@ f@@ y , to c@@ la@@ im their own des@@ cri@@ p@@ tions of the@@ m@@ selves ,
so they can go al@@ ig@@ n with glob@@ al grou@@ ps of their own cho@@ os@@ ing .
So , per@@ h@@ ap@@ s technology is re@@ v@@ e@@ al@@ ing more c@@ lear@@ ly to us now what has always been a tru@@ th : that every@@ one has something r@@ are and po@@ wer@@ ful to off@@ er our soci@@ et@@ y , and that the human abili@@ ty to ad@@ ap@@ t is our gre@@ at@@ est as@@ set .
The human abili@@ ty to ad@@ ap@@ t , it &apos;s an interesting thing , because people have con@@ tin@@ u@@ ally wanted to talk to me about o@@ ver@@ coming ad@@ vers@@ ity , and I &apos;m going to make an ad@@ mis@@ sion : This p@@ hr@@ ase never s@@ at right with me , and I always f@@ elt un@@ eas@@ y trying to ans@@ wer people &apos;s ques@@ tions about it , and I think I &apos;m star@@ ting to fig@@ ure out why .
I@@ mp@@ lic@@ it in this p@@ hr@@ ase of &quot; o@@ ver@@ coming ad@@ vers@@ ity &quot; is the idea that su@@ c@@ cess , or happ@@ iness , is about em@@ erg@@ ing on the other side of a ch@@ all@@ en@@ ging experi@@ ence uns@@ c@@ a@@ th@@ ed or un@@ mar@@ ked by the experi@@ ence , as if my su@@ c@@ c@@ ess@@ es in life have come about from an abili@@ ty to si@@ des@@ te@@ p or c@@ ir@@ c@@ um@@ n@@ avi@@ g@@ ate the pres@@ um@@ ed p@@ it@@ f@@ alls of a life with pr@@ os@@ the@@ tic@@ s , or what other people perc@@ ei@@ ve as my dis@@ abili@@ ty .
But , in fact , we are chan@@ g@@ ed . We are mar@@ ked , of course , by a ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge , wh@@ e@@ ther physi@@ c@@ ally , em@@ o@@ tion@@ ally or bot@@ h .
And I &apos;m going to su@@ g@@ ges@@ t that this is a good thing .
A@@ d@@ vers@@ ity is@@ n &apos;t an ob@@ st@@ ac@@ le that we need to get around in or@@ der to res@@ u@@ me li@@ ving our life .
It &apos;s part of our life .
And I t@@ end to think of it like my s@@ ha@@ d@@ ow .
S@@ om@@ e@@ times I see a lot of it , some@@ times there &apos;s very little , but it &apos;s always with me .
And , cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly , I &apos;m not trying to di@@ min@@ ish the imp@@ act , the wei@@ ght , of a person &apos;s stru@@ g@@ g@@ le .
There is ad@@ vers@@ ity and ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge in life , and it &apos;s all very real and rel@@ ative to every s@@ ing@@ le person , but the question is@@ n &apos;t wh@@ e@@ ther or not you &apos;re going to me@@ et ad@@ vers@@ ity , but how you &apos;re going to me@@ et it .
So , our res@@ pon@@ si@@ bi@@ li@@ ty is not sim@@ p@@ ly shi@@ el@@ ding those we c@@ are for from ad@@ vers@@ ity , but pre@@ par@@ ing them to me@@ et it well .
And we do a dis@@ ser@@ vi@@ ce to our kids when we make them feel that they &apos;re not e@@ qui@@ pp@@ ed to ad@@ ap@@ t .
There &apos;s an important differ@@ ence and dis@@ tin@@ c@@ tion between the ob@@ j@@ ec@@ tive medi@@ cal fact of my being an am@@ pu@@ te@@ e and the sub@@ j@@ ec@@ tive soci@@ et@@ al op@@ ini@@ on of wh@@ e@@ ther or not I &apos;m dis@@ ab@@ l@@ ed .
And , tru@@ th@@ f@@ ul@@ ly , the only real and con@@ s@@ ist@@ ent dis@@ abili@@ ty I &apos;ve had to con@@ f@@ ron@@ t is the world ever thinking that I could be des@@ cri@@ b@@ ed by those de@@ fin@@ i@@ tions .
In our des@@ ir@@ e to pr@@ ot@@ ect those we c@@ are about by gi@@ ving them the c@@ old , har@@ d tru@@ th about their medi@@ cal pro@@ g@@ n@@ os@@ is , or , in@@ de@@ ed , a pro@@ g@@ n@@ os@@ is on the exp@@ ec@@ ted qu@@ ality of their life , we have to make s@@ ure that we don &apos;t put the first bri@@ ck in a w@@ all that will actually dis@@ able some@@ one .
Per@@ h@@ ap@@ s the ex@@ is@@ ting mo@@ del of only looking at what is bro@@ ken in you and how do we fi@@ x it , ser@@ ves to be more dis@@ ab@@ l@@ ing to the in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al than the pa@@ th@@ olog@@ y it@@ self .
B@@ y not tre@@ ating the wh@@ ol@@ en@@ ess of a person , by not ac@@ kno@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ging their p@@ ot@@ en@@ cy , we are cre@@ ating another il@@ l on top of wh@@ at@@ ever nat@@ ur@@ al stru@@ g@@ g@@ le they might have .
We are eff@@ ec@@ tiv@@ ely gra@@ ding some@@ one &apos;s wor@@ th to our comm@@ unity .
So we need to see through the pa@@ th@@ olog@@ y and into the ran@@ ge of human cap@@ abili@@ ty .
And , most import@@ ant@@ ly , there &apos;s a par@@ t@@ n@@ er@@ shi@@ p between those perc@@ ei@@ ved de@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ en@@ ci@@ es and our gre@@ at@@ est cre@@ ative abili@@ ty .
So it &apos;s not about de@@ val@@ u@@ ing , or ne@@ g@@ ating , these more trying times as something we want to av@@ o@@ id or s@@ we@@ ep un@@ der the ru@@ g , but in@@ ste@@ ad to find those op@@ port@@ uni@@ ties w@@ r@@ app@@ ed in the ad@@ vers@@ ity .
So maybe the idea I want to put out there is not so much o@@ ver@@ coming ad@@ vers@@ ity as it is op@@ en@@ ing our@@ selves up to it , em@@ bra@@ c@@ ing it , gr@@ ap@@ pl@@ ing with it , to use a w@@ res@@ t@@ l@@ ing ter@@ m , maybe even dan@@ c@@ ing with it .
And , per@@ h@@ ap@@ s , if we see ad@@ vers@@ ity as nat@@ ur@@ al , con@@ s@@ ist@@ ent and us@@ e@@ ful , we &apos;re less b@@ ur@@ den@@ ed by the pres@@ ence of it .
This year we c@@ el@@ e@@ bra@@ te the 200@@ th b@@ ir@@ th@@ day of C@@ har@@ les D@@ ar@@ w@@ in , and it was 1@@ 50 years ago , when w@@ ri@@ ting about evol@@ ution , that D@@ ar@@ w@@ in il@@ lu@@ str@@ ated , I think , a tru@@ th about the human char@@ ac@@ ter .
T@@ o par@@ ap@@ hr@@ ase : It &apos;s not the str@@ on@@ ges@@ t of the spec@@ ies that sur@@ vi@@ ves , n@@ or is it the most in@@ tel@@ li@@ g@@ ent that sur@@ vi@@ ves ; it is the one that is most ad@@ ap@@ t@@ able to change .
C@@ on@@ f@@ lic@@ t is the gen@@ es@@ is of cre@@ ation .
F@@ rom D@@ ar@@ w@@ in &apos;s work , am@@ on@@ g@@ st o@@ th@@ ers , we can rec@@ og@@ ni@@ ze that the human abili@@ ty to sur@@ vi@@ ve and fl@@ our@@ ish is dri@@ ven by the stru@@ g@@ g@@ le of the human sp@@ ir@@ it through con@@ f@@ lic@@ t into trans@@ formation .
So , again , trans@@ formation , ad@@ ap@@ ta@@ tion , is our gre@@ at@@ est human sk@@ il@@ l .
And , per@@ h@@ ap@@ s , un@@ ti@@ l we &apos;re t@@ es@@ ted , we don &apos;t know what we &apos;re made of .
Ma@@ ybe that &apos;s what ad@@ vers@@ ity gi@@ ves us : a sense of self , a sense of our own power .
So , we can give our@@ selves a gi@@ ft .
We can re@@ -@@ ima@@ g@@ ine ad@@ vers@@ ity as something more than just t@@ ough times .
Ma@@ ybe we can see it as change .
A@@ d@@ vers@@ ity is just change that we ha@@ ven &apos;t ad@@ ap@@ ted our@@ selves to y@@ et .
I think the gre@@ at@@ est ad@@ vers@@ ity that we &apos;ve cre@@ ated for our@@ selves is this idea of nor@@ m@@ al@@ cy .
Now , who &apos;s nor@@ mal ?
There &apos;s no nor@@ mal .
There &apos;s comm@@ on , there &apos;s t@@ y@@ pic@@ al . There &apos;s no nor@@ mal , and would you want to me@@ et that po@@ or , bei@@ ge person if they ex@@ is@@ ted ?
I don &apos;t think so .
If we can change this par@@ a@@ dig@@ m from one of ach@@ i@@ ev@@ ing nor@@ m@@ al@@ cy to one of possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ty -- or p@@ ot@@ en@@ cy , to be even a little bit more dan@@ ger@@ ous -- we can rel@@ e@@ ase the power of so many more children , and in@@ vi@@ te them to eng@@ age their r@@ are and val@@ u@@ able abili@@ ties with the comm@@ unity .
An@@ th@@ rop@@ olog@@ is@@ ts tell us that the one thing we as hum@@ ans have always re@@ qui@@ red of our comm@@ unity mem@@ ber@@ s is to be of use , to be able to con@@ tri@@ bu@@ te .
There &apos;s e@@ vi@@ den@@ ce that Ne@@ ander@@ th@@ als , 6@@ 0@@ ,000 years ago , car@@ ri@@ ed their el@@ der@@ ly and those with s@@ eri@@ ous physi@@ cal in@@ j@@ ur@@ y , and per@@ h@@ ap@@ s it &apos;s because the life experi@@ ence of sur@@ vi@@ v@@ al of these people pro@@ ved of val@@ ue to the comm@@ unity .
They didn &apos;t vie@@ w these people as bro@@ ken and us@@ el@@ ess ; they were se@@ en as r@@ are and val@@ u@@ able .
A few years ago , I was in a food mark@@ et in the to@@ wn where I gre@@ w up in that red z@@ one in nor@@ the@@ ast@@ ern P@@ en@@ n@@ sy@@ l@@ v@@ ani@@ a , and I was stand@@ ing over a bus@@ h@@ el of t@@ om@@ at@@ o@@ es .
It was su@@ mm@@ er@@ time : I had sh@@ or@@ ts on .
I he@@ ar this gu@@ y , his v@@ o@@ ice beh@@ ind me say , &quot; Well , if it is@@ n &apos;t A@@ im@@ e@@ e M@@ ul@@ lin@@ s . &quot;
And I tur@@ n around , and it &apos;s this ol@@ der man . I have no idea who he is .
And I said , &quot; I &apos;m sor@@ ry , si@@ r , have we me@@ t ? I don &apos;t re@@ mem@@ ber me@@ et@@ ing you . &quot;
He said , &quot; Well , you w@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t re@@ mem@@ ber me@@ et@@ ing me .
I mean , when we me@@ t I was de@@ li@@ ver@@ ing you from your mo@@ ther &apos;s wom@@ b . &quot;
Oh , that gu@@ y .
And , but of course , actually , it did cli@@ ck .
This man was D@@ r@@ . K@@ e@@ an , a man that I had only kno@@ wn about through my mo@@ ther &apos;s stor@@ ies of that day , because , of course , t@@ y@@ pic@@ al fas@@ hi@@ on , I ar@@ ri@@ ved l@@ ate for my b@@ ir@@ th@@ day by two we@@ e@@ ks .
And so my mo@@ ther &apos;s pr@@ en@@ at@@ al physi@@ ci@@ an had g@@ one on v@@ ac@@ ation , so the man who de@@ li@@ ver@@ ed me was a comp@@ le@@ te st@@ ran@@ ger to my par@@ ents .
And , because I was bor@@ n with@@ out the fi@@ b@@ ul@@ a b@@ ones , and had fe@@ et tur@@ ned in , and a few to@@ es in this fo@@ ot and a few to@@ es in that , he had to be the be@@ ar@@ er -- this st@@ ran@@ ger had to be the be@@ ar@@ er of b@@ ad ne@@ ws .
He said to me , &quot; I had to give this pro@@ g@@ n@@ os@@ is to your par@@ ents that you would never w@@ alk , and you would never have the kind of mo@@ bi@@ li@@ ty that other kids have or any kind of life of in@@ de@@ p@@ en@@ den@@ ce , and you &apos;ve been making li@@ ar out of me ever sin@@ ce . &quot;
The ex@@ tra@@ ord@@ in@@ ary thing is that he said he had sa@@ ved ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er cli@@ pp@@ ings thr@@ ou@@ gh@@ out my whole chil@@ d@@ ho@@ od , wh@@ e@@ ther w@@ inn@@ ing a second gra@@ de sp@@ ell@@ ing be@@ e , mar@@ ch@@ ing with the G@@ ir@@ l S@@ cou@@ ts , you know , the H@@ al@@ lo@@ ween par@@ ade , w@@ inn@@ ing my col@@ le@@ ge sch@@ ol@@ ar@@ shi@@ p , or any of my sp@@ or@@ ts vi@@ c@@ t@@ or@@ ies , and he was using it , and in@@ te@@ gr@@ ating it into te@@ ach@@ ing res@@ i@@ d@@ ent stu@@ d@@ ents , m@@ ed stu@@ d@@ ents from H@@ ah@@ ne@@ m@@ ann Medi@@ cal Sch@@ ool and Her@@ sh@@ ey Medi@@ cal Sch@@ ool .
And he called this part of the course the X F@@ ac@@ tor , the p@@ ot@@ enti@@ al of the human will .
No pro@@ g@@ n@@ os@@ is can ac@@ coun@@ t for how po@@ wer@@ ful this could be as a de@@ ter@@ min@@ ant in the qu@@ ality of some@@ one &apos;s life .
And D@@ r@@ . K@@ e@@ an went on to tell me , he said , &quot; In my experi@@ ence , un@@ less re@@ pe@@ at@@ e@@ d@@ ly t@@ old o@@ ther@@ wis@@ e , and even if gi@@ ven a mo@@ dic@@ um of supp@@ ort , if left to their own de@@ vi@@ ces , a ch@@ ild will ach@@ ie@@ ve . &quot;
Se@@ e , D@@ r@@ . K@@ e@@ an made that shi@@ ft in thinking .
He under@@ sto@@ od that there &apos;s a differ@@ ence between the medi@@ cal con@@ di@@ tion and what some@@ one might do with it .
And there &apos;s been a shi@@ ft in my thinking over time , in that , if you had as@@ ked me at 15 years old , if I would have tra@@ ded pr@@ os@@ the@@ tic@@ s for fl@@ es@@ h@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ b@@ one le@@ gs , I w@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t have h@@ es@@ it@@ ated for a second .
I as@@ pi@@ red to that kind of nor@@ m@@ al@@ cy back then .
But if you ask me today , I &apos;m not so s@@ ure .
And it &apos;s because of the experi@@ en@@ ces I &apos;ve had with them , not in spi@@ te of the experi@@ en@@ ces I &apos;ve had with them .
And per@@ h@@ ap@@ s this shi@@ ft in me has happened because I &apos;ve been ex@@ pos@@ ed to more people who have op@@ en@@ ed do@@ ors for me than those who have put li@@ ds and c@@ ast s@@ ha@@ do@@ ws on me .
Se@@ e , all you really need is one person to show you the e@@ pi@@ ph@@ any of your own power , and you &apos;re off .
If you can h@@ and some@@ body the k@@ ey to their own power -- the human sp@@ ir@@ it is so rec@@ ep@@ tive -- if you can do that and op@@ en a do@@ or for some@@ one at a c@@ ru@@ ci@@ al m@@ oment , you are e@@ duc@@ ating them in the best sense .
You &apos;re te@@ ach@@ ing them to op@@ en do@@ ors for the@@ m@@ selves .
In fact , the ex@@ act me@@ an@@ ing of the wor@@ d &quot; e@@ duc@@ ate &quot; comes from the ro@@ ot wor@@ d &quot; e@@ du@@ ce . &quot;
It means &quot; to br@@ ing for@@ th what is with@@ in , to br@@ ing out p@@ ot@@ enti@@ al . &quot;
So again , which p@@ ot@@ enti@@ al do we want to br@@ ing out ?
There was a c@@ ase stu@@ dy done in 19@@ 6@@ 0@@ s B@@ ri@@ tain , when they were mo@@ ving from gra@@ m@@ ma@@ r sch@@ o@@ ol@@ s to comp@@ re@@ h@@ ensi@@ ve sch@@ o@@ ol@@ s .
It &apos;s called the stre@@ am@@ ing tri@@ als . We call it &quot; tra@@ ck@@ ing &quot; here in the St@@ ates .
It &apos;s se@@ par@@ ating stu@@ d@@ ents from A , B , C , D and so on .
And the &quot; A stu@@ d@@ ents &quot; get the t@@ ou@@ gh@@ er cur@@ ri@@ cul@@ um , the best te@@ ach@@ ers , et@@ c .
Well , they took , over a th@@ re@@ e-@@ mon@@ th per@@ i@@ od , D@@ -@@ le@@ v@@ el stu@@ d@@ ents , ga@@ ve them A &apos;s , t@@ old them they were &quot; A &apos;s , &quot; t@@ old them they were b@@ right , and at the end of this th@@ re@@ e-@@ mon@@ th per@@ i@@ od , they were per@@ for@@ m@@ ing at A@@ -@@ le@@ v@@ el .
And , of course , the hear@@ t@@ bre@@ a@@ king , f@@ li@@ p side of this stu@@ dy , is that they took the &quot; A stu@@ d@@ ents &quot; and t@@ old them they were &quot; D &apos;s . &quot;
And that &apos;s what happened at the end of that th@@ re@@ e-@@ mon@@ th per@@ i@@ od .
Th@@ ose who were still around in school , bes@@ i@@ des the people who had dro@@ pp@@ ed out .
A c@@ ru@@ ci@@ al part of this c@@ ase stu@@ dy was that the te@@ ach@@ ers were du@@ p@@ ed too .
The te@@ ach@@ ers didn &apos;t know a s@@ wi@@ t@@ ch had been made .
They were sim@@ p@@ ly t@@ old , &quot; These are the &apos; A@@ -@@ stu@@ d@@ ents , &apos; these are the &apos; D@@ -@@ stu@@ d@@ ents . &apos; &quot; And that &apos;s how they went about te@@ ach@@ ing them and tre@@ ating them .
So , I think that the only tr@@ ue dis@@ abili@@ ty is a c@@ r@@ us@@ h@@ ed sp@@ ir@@ it , a sp@@ ir@@ it that &apos;s been c@@ r@@ us@@ h@@ ed doesn &apos;t have hop@@ e , it doesn &apos;t see beau@@ ty , it no l@@ on@@ ger has our nat@@ ur@@ al , chil@@ d@@ like c@@ u@@ ri@@ os@@ ity and our inn@@ ate abili@@ ty to ima@@ g@@ ine .
If in@@ ste@@ ad , we can b@@ ol@@ ster a human sp@@ ir@@ it to ke@@ ep hop@@ e , to see beau@@ ty in the@@ m@@ selves and o@@ th@@ ers , to be c@@ u@@ ri@@ ous and ima@@ g@@ in@@ ative , then we are tru@@ ly using our power well .
When a sp@@ ir@@ it has those qu@@ ali@@ ties , we are able to create new re@@ ali@@ ties and new ways of being .
I &apos;d like to lea@@ ve you with a po@@ em by a f@@ our@@ te@@ en@@ th@@ -@@ cent@@ ur@@ y Per@@ si@@ an po@@ et nam@@ ed Ha@@ fi@@ z that my fri@@ end , J@@ ac@@ qu@@ es D@@ em@@ bo@@ is t@@ old me about , and the po@@ em is called &quot; The G@@ od Wh@@ o O@@ n@@ ly K@@ no@@ ws F@@ our Wor@@ ds &quot; : &quot; E@@ very ch@@ ild has kno@@ wn G@@ od , not the G@@ od of nam@@ es , not the G@@ od of don &apos;@@ ts , but the G@@ od who only kno@@ ws four wor@@ ds and ke@@ ep@@ s re@@ pe@@ ating them , sa@@ ying , &apos; C@@ ome dan@@ ce with me .
C@@ ome , dan@@ ce with me . C@@ ome , dan@@ ce with me . &apos; &quot; Thank you .
