L@@ ast year I sho@@ w@@ ed these two s@@ li@@ des so that de@@ mon@@ stra@@ te that the ar@@ c@@ tic ice c@@ a@@ p , which for most of the last three million years has been the si@@ ze of the lo@@ wer 4@@ 8 st@@ ates , has s@@ hr@@ un@@ k by 4@@ 0 percent .
But this under@@ st@@ ates the s@@ eri@@ ous@@ ness of this partic@@ ular problem because it doesn &apos;t show the th@@ i@@ ck@@ ness of the ice .
The ar@@ c@@ tic ice c@@ a@@ p is , in a sense , the be@@ ating hear@@ t of the glob@@ al cli@@ ma@@ te system .
It exp@@ and@@ s in win@@ ter and con@@ tra@@ c@@ ts in su@@ m@@ mer .
The next s@@ li@@ de I show you will be a rap@@ id fa@@ st@@ -@@ for@@ ward of what &apos;s happened over the last 2@@ 5 years .
The per@@ man@@ ent ice is mar@@ ked in red .
A@@ s you see , it exp@@ and@@ s to the dar@@ k b@@ lu@@ e -- that &apos;s the an@@ n@@ u@@ al ice in win@@ ter , and it con@@ tra@@ c@@ ts in su@@ m@@ mer .
The so@@ -@@ called per@@ man@@ ent ice , five years old or ol@@ der , you can see is al@@ most like blo@@ od , sp@@ ill@@ ing out of the body here .
In 2@@ 5 years it &apos;s g@@ one from this , to this .
This is a problem because the war@@ m@@ ing he@@ at@@ s up the f@@ ro@@ zen gro@@ und around the Ar@@ c@@ tic O@@ ce@@ an , where there is a m@@ assi@@ ve am@@ o@@ un@@ t of f@@ ro@@ zen car@@ b@@ on which , when it th@@ a@@ ws , is tur@@ ned into me@@ th@@ an@@ e by m@@ ic@@ ro@@ b@@ es .
Com@@ par@@ ed to the t@@ ot@@ al am@@ o@@ un@@ t of glob@@ al war@@ m@@ ing p@@ oll@@ ution in the at@@ mos@@ p@@ here , that am@@ o@@ un@@ t could d@@ ou@@ ble if we c@@ ross this ti@@ pp@@ ing point .
Al@@ ready in some sh@@ al@@ low la@@ kes in Al@@ as@@ ka , me@@ th@@ an@@ e is ac@@ tiv@@ ely bu@@ b@@ bl@@ ing up out of the water .
Pro@@ f@@ ess@@ or K@@ at@@ ey W@@ al@@ ter from the Univers@@ ity of Al@@ as@@ ka went out with another te@@ am to another sh@@ al@@ low la@@ ke last win@@ ter .
V@@ ide@@ o : Wh@@ o@@ a ! A@@ l G@@ ore : S@@ he &apos;s ok@@ ay . The question is wh@@ e@@ ther we will be .
And one reas@@ on is , this en@@ or@@ m@@ ous he@@ at sin@@ k he@@ at@@ s up G@@ re@@ en@@ land from the nor@@ th .
This is an an@@ n@@ u@@ al m@@ el@@ ting ri@@ ver .
But the vol@@ um@@ es are much lar@@ ger than ever .
This is the K@@ an@@ ger@@ lus@@ su@@ a@@ q Ri@@ ver in s@@ ou@@ th@@ w@@ est G@@ re@@ en@@ land .
If you want to know how se@@ a le@@ v@@ el ris@@ es from l@@ and@@ -@@ b@@ ase ice m@@ el@@ ting this is where it re@@ ach@@ es the se@@ a .
These flo@@ ws are incre@@ as@@ ing very rap@@ i@@ d@@ ly .
A@@ t the other end of the planet , Ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic@@ a the lar@@ ges@@ t m@@ ass of ice on the planet .
L@@ ast mon@@ th sci@@ enti@@ st@@ s re@@ por@@ ted the enti@@ re con@@ tin@@ ent is now in ne@@ g@@ ative ice b@@ al@@ ance .
And w@@ est Ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic@@ a c@@ ro@@ pp@@ ed up on top some under@@ -@@ se@@ a is@@ l@@ and@@ s , is partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly rap@@ id in its m@@ el@@ ting .
That &apos;s e@@ qu@@ al to 20 fe@@ et of se@@ a le@@ v@@ el , as is G@@ re@@ en@@ land .
In the H@@ im@@ al@@ a@@ y@@ as , the th@@ ir@@ d lar@@ ges@@ t m@@ ass of ice : at the top you see new la@@ kes , which a few years ago were gl@@ ac@@ i@@ ers .
4@@ 0 percent of all the people in the world get hal@@ f of their dr@@ in@@ king water from that m@@ el@@ ting f@@ low .
In the An@@ des , this gl@@ ac@@ ier is the s@@ our@@ ce of dr@@ in@@ king water for this city .
The flo@@ ws have incre@@ as@@ ed .
But when they go away , so does much of the dr@@ in@@ king water .
In C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a there has been a 4@@ 0 percent de@@ cl@@ ine in the Si@@ er@@ r@@ a s@@ no@@ w@@ p@@ ack .
This is h@@ it@@ ting the res@@ er@@ v@@ o@@ ir@@ s .
And the pre@@ dic@@ tions , as you &apos;ve re@@ ad , are s@@ eri@@ ous .
This dr@@ ying around the world has le@@ ad to a dra@@ ma@@ tic incre@@ ase in fir@@ es .
And the dis@@ ast@@ ers around the world have been incre@@ as@@ ing at an ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely ex@@ tra@@ ord@@ in@@ ary and un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ent@@ ed ra@@ te .
F@@ our times as many in the last 30 years as in the pre@@ vi@@ ous 7@@ 5 .
This is a comp@@ let@@ ely un@@ su@@ sta@@ in@@ able pat@@ tern .
If you look at in the con@@ te@@ xt of hist@@ ory you can see what this is doing .
In the last five years we &apos;ve ad@@ ded 7@@ 0 million t@@ ons of C@@ O@@ 2 every 2@@ 4 h@@ our@@ s -- 2@@ 5 million t@@ ons every day to the o@@ ce@@ ans .
L@@ oo@@ k car@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly at the are@@ a of the e@@ ast@@ ern P@@ ac@@ i@@ fi@@ c , from the A@@ mer@@ ic@@ as , ex@@ ten@@ ding w@@ est@@ ward , and on ei@@ ther side of the Indi@@ an sub@@ con@@ tin@@ ent , where there is a ra@@ di@@ cal de@@ ple@@ tion of o@@ x@@ y@@ gen in the o@@ ce@@ ans .
The b@@ ig@@ ges@@ t s@@ ing@@ le c@@ ause of glob@@ al war@@ m@@ ing , al@@ ong with de@@ for@@ es@@ ta@@ tion , which is 20 percent of it , is the b@@ ur@@ ning of f@@ os@@ si@@ l fu@@ els .
O@@ il is a problem , and co@@ al is the most s@@ eri@@ ous problem .
The Un@@ ited St@@ ates is one of the two lar@@ ges@@ t em@@ it@@ ters , al@@ ong with Chin@@ a .
And the pro@@ pos@@ al has been to bu@@ ild a lot more co@@ al plan@@ ts .
But we &apos;re beg@@ inn@@ ing to see a se@@ a change .
Here are the ones that have been can@@ c@@ ell@@ ed in the last few years with some gre@@ en al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ ves pro@@ pos@@ ed .
H@@ o@@ we@@ ver there is a poli@@ tical b@@ att@@ le in our country .
And the co@@ al in@@ du@@ stri@@ es and the o@@ il in@@ du@@ stri@@ es sp@@ ent a qu@@ ar@@ ter of a b@@ illion dollars in the last c@@ al@@ end@@ ar year pro@@ m@@ ot@@ ing cle@@ an co@@ al , which is an o@@ x@@ y@@ mor@@ on .
That ima@@ ge re@@ min@@ ded me of something .
A@@ ro@@ und Chr@@ ist@@ m@@ as , in my h@@ ome in T@@ en@@ n@@ es@@ see , a b@@ illion g@@ all@@ ons of co@@ al s@@ lu@@ dge was sp@@ ill@@ ed .
You probably sa@@ w it on the ne@@ ws .
This , all over the country , is the second lar@@ ges@@ t wa@@ ste stre@@ am in A@@ mer@@ ic@@ a .
This happened around Chr@@ ist@@ m@@ as .
One of the co@@ al in@@ du@@ str@@ y &apos;s a@@ ds around Chr@@ ist@@ m@@ as was this one .

L@@ ast year at TED I ga@@ ve an in@@ tro@@ duc@@ tion to the L@@ H@@ C .
And I pro@@ mis@@ ed to come back and give you an up@@ da@@ te on how that ma@@ ch@@ ine wor@@ ked .
So this is it . And for those of you that wer@@ en &apos;t there , the L@@ H@@ C is the lar@@ ges@@ t sci@@ enti@@ fi@@ c exper@@ im@@ ent ever att@@ em@@ p@@ ted -- 2@@ 7 k@@ il@@ om@@ e@@ ters in c@@ ir@@ c@@ um@@ fer@@ ence .
I@@ ts j@@ ob is to re@@ create the con@@ di@@ tions that were pres@@ ent less than a b@@ illi@@ on@@ th of a second after the uni@@ verse beg@@ an , up to 6@@ 00 million times a second .
It &apos;s no@@ thing if not am@@ bi@@ ti@@ ous .
This is the ma@@ ch@@ ine bel@@ ow Gen@@ ev@@ a .
We take the pic@@ tur@@ es of those min@@ i@@ -@@ Bi@@ g B@@ an@@ gs in@@ side de@@ t@@ ec@@ t@@ ors .
This is the one I work on . It &apos;s called the A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S de@@ t@@ ec@@ tor -- 4@@ 4 me@@ ters wi@@ de , 2@@ 2 me@@ ters in di@@ am@@ eter .
Sp@@ ec@@ t@@ ac@@ ular pic@@ ture here of A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S un@@ der con@@ struc@@ tion so you can see the sc@@ ale .
O@@ n the 10@@ th of S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber last year we tur@@ ned the ma@@ ch@@ ine on for the first time .
And this pic@@ ture was ta@@ ken by A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S .
It c@@ aus@@ ed im@@ men@@ se c@@ el@@ e@@ bra@@ tion in the con@@ tro@@ l ro@@ om .
It &apos;s a pic@@ ture of the first be@@ am partic@@ le going all the way around the L@@ H@@ C , col@@ li@@ ding with a piec@@ e of the L@@ H@@ C de@@ li@@ ber@@ at@@ ely , and sho@@ wer@@ ing partic@@ les into the de@@ t@@ ec@@ tor .
In other wor@@ ds , when we sa@@ w that pic@@ ture on S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber 10@@ th we k@@ new the ma@@ ch@@ ine wor@@ ked , which is a great tri@@ um@@ p@@ h .
I don &apos;t know wh@@ e@@ ther this got the b@@ ig@@ ges@@ t ch@@ e@@ er , or this , when some@@ one went on@@ to Go@@ og@@ le and sa@@ w the f@@ ron@@ t pa@@ ge was like that .
It means we made cul@@ tur@@ al imp@@ act as well as sci@@ enti@@ fi@@ c imp@@ act .
Ab@@ out a we@@ e@@ k l@@ ater we had a problem with the ma@@ ch@@ ine , rel@@ ated actually to these b@@ its of wi@@ re here -- these g@@ old wir@@ es .
Th@@ ose wir@@ es car@@ ry 1@@ 3 thou@@ s@@ and am@@ ps when the ma@@ ch@@ ine is working in f@@ ul@@ l power .
Now the eng@@ in@@ e@@ ers am@@ on@@ g@@ st you will look at them and say , &quot; No they don &apos;t . They &apos;re small wir@@ es . &quot;
They can do that because when they are very c@@ old they are what &apos;s called su@@ per@@ con@@ duc@@ ting wi@@ re .
So at min@@ us 2@@ 7@@ 1 de@@ gre@@ es , col@@ der than the space between the star@@ s , those wir@@ es can take that cur@@ r@@ ent .
In one of the j@@ o@@ in@@ ts between over 9@@ ,000 ma@@ g@@ n@@ ets in L@@ H@@ C , there was a man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing de@@ f@@ ect .
So the wi@@ re he@@ ated up s@@ li@@ gh@@ tly , and its 1@@ 3@@ ,000 am@@ ps su@@ d@@ den@@ ly en@@ co@@ unter@@ ed elec@@ tri@@ cal res@@ ist@@ ance .
This was the res@@ ul@@ t .
Now that &apos;s more im@@ pres@@ si@@ ve when you con@@ si@@ der those ma@@ g@@ n@@ ets wei@@ gh over 20 t@@ ons , and they mo@@ ved about a fo@@ ot .
So we da@@ ma@@ g@@ ed about 50 of the ma@@ g@@ n@@ ets .
We had to take them out , which we did .
We re@@ con@@ di@@ tion@@ ed them all , fi@@ x@@ ed them .
They &apos;re all on their way back under@@ gro@@ und now .
B@@ y the end of Mar@@ ch the L@@ H@@ C will be in@@ t@@ act again .
We will s@@ wi@@ t@@ ch it on , and we exp@@ ect to take data in J@@ un@@ e or J@@ u@@ ly , and con@@ tin@@ ue with our qu@@ est to find out what the building blo@@ cks of the uni@@ verse are .
Now of course , in a way those ac@@ ci@@ d@@ ents rei@@ g@@ ni@@ te the de@@ b@@ ate about the val@@ ue of sci@@ ence and eng@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ing at the e@@ dge . It &apos;s eas@@ y to re@@ fu@@ te .
I think that the fact that it &apos;s so diff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t , the fact that we &apos;re o@@ ver@@ re@@ ach@@ ing , is the val@@ ue of things like the L@@ H@@ C .
I will lea@@ ve the fin@@ al wor@@ d to an En@@ g@@ li@@ s@@ h sci@@ enti@@ st , H@@ um@@ ph@@ re@@ y D@@ av@@ y , who , I s@@ us@@ p@@ ect , when de@@ f@@ en@@ ding his pr@@ ot@@ e@@ ge &apos;s us@@ el@@ ess exper@@ im@@ ents -- his pr@@ ot@@ e@@ ge was Mi@@ ch@@ a@@ el F@@ ar@@ ad@@ ay -- said this , &quot; N@@ o@@ thing is so dan@@ ger@@ ous to the pro@@ g@@ res@@ s of the human m@@ ind than to as@@ su@@ me that our vie@@ ws of sci@@ ence are ul@@ ti@@ ma@@ te , that there are no my@@ st@@ eri@@ es in nat@@ ure , that our tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s are comp@@ le@@ te , and that there are no new wor@@ l@@ ds to con@@ qu@@ er . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start out by as@@ king you to think back to when you were a k@@ id , pla@@ ying with blo@@ cks .
A@@ s you fig@@ u@@ red out how to re@@ ach out and gr@@ as@@ p , pic@@ k them up and mo@@ ve them around , you were actually lear@@ ning how to think and sol@@ ve proble@@ ms by under@@ stand@@ ing and man@@ i@@ p@@ ul@@ ating sp@@ ati@@ al rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ ps .
S@@ pa@@ ti@@ al reas@@ on@@ ing is de@@ ep@@ ly connec@@ ted to how we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , as a compu@@ ter sci@@ enti@@ st in@@ spi@@ red by this u@@ ti@@ li@@ ty of our inter@@ ac@@ tions with physi@@ cal ob@@ j@@ ects -- al@@ ong with my ad@@ vis@@ er P@@ att@@ ie , and my c@@ oll@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ or Je@@ ev@@ an K@@ al@@ ani@@ th@@ i -- I started to w@@ on@@ der -- what if when we used a compu@@ ter , in@@ ste@@ ad of ha@@ ving this one m@@ ou@@ se cur@@ s@@ or that was a like a dig@@ ital f@@ ing@@ er@@ ti@@ p mo@@ ving around a fl@@ at des@@ k@@ top , what if we could re@@ ach in with bot@@ h hand@@ s and gr@@ as@@ p in@@ formation physi@@ c@@ ally ,
ar@@ ran@@ ging it the way we wanted ?
This question was so comp@@ ell@@ ing that we de@@ ci@@ ded to ex@@ pl@@ ore the ans@@ wer , by building Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les .
In a n@@ ut@@ sh@@ ell , a Si@@ ft@@ able is an inter@@ ac@@ tive compu@@ ter the si@@ ze of a co@@ ok@@ ie .
They &apos;re able to be mo@@ ved around by h@@ and , they can sense each other , they can sense their mo@@ tion , and they have a s@@ cre@@ en and a wir@@ el@@ ess ra@@ di@@ o .
M@@ ost import@@ ant@@ ly , they &apos;re physi@@ cal , so like the blo@@ cks , you can mo@@ ve them just by re@@ ach@@ ing out and gr@@ as@@ p@@ ing .
And Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les are an example of a new ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem of to@@ ol@@ s for man@@ i@@ p@@ ul@@ ating dig@@ ital in@@ formation .
And as these to@@ ol@@ s be@@ come more physi@@ cal , more a@@ w@@ are of their mo@@ tion , a@@ w@@ are of each other , and a@@ w@@ are of the n@@ u@@ ance of how we mo@@ ve them , we can start to ex@@ pl@@ ore some new and f@@ un inter@@ ac@@ tion st@@ y@@ les .
So , I &apos;m going to start with some sim@@ ple exam@@ pl@@ es .
This Si@@ ft@@ able is con@@ fig@@ u@@ red to show vi@@ de@@ o , and if I ti@@ lt it in one di@@ rec@@ tion , it &apos;ll ro@@ ll the vi@@ de@@ o this way ; if I ti@@ lt it the other way it ro@@ ll@@ s it b@@ ack@@ war@@ ds .
And these inter@@ ac@@ tive por@@ tra@@ its are a@@ w@@ are of each other .
So if I put them next to each other , they get interes@@ ted .
If they get sur@@ ro@@ und@@ ed , they no@@ ti@@ ce that too , they might get a little f@@ lu@@ ster@@ ed .
And they can also sense their mo@@ tion and ti@@ lt .
One of the interesting imp@@ lic@@ ations on inter@@ ac@@ tion , we started to re@@ ali@@ ze , was that we could use every@@ day ges@@ tur@@ es on data , like p@@ our@@ ing a col@@ or the way we might p@@ our a li@@ qu@@ id .
So in this c@@ ase , we &apos;ve got three Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les con@@ fig@@ u@@ red to be pa@@ int bu@@ ck@@ ets and I can use them to p@@ our col@@ or into that cent@@ ra@@ l one , where they get mi@@ x@@ ed .
If we o@@ ver@@ sh@@ oo@@ t , we can p@@ our a little bit back .
There are also some ne@@ at possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ties for e@@ duc@@ ation , like lan@@ gu@@ age , mat@@ h and lo@@ gi@@ c g@@ am@@ es where we want to give people the abili@@ ty to try things qui@@ ck@@ ly , and vie@@ w the res@@ ul@@ ts im@@ medi@@ at@@ ely .
So here I &apos;m -- This is a F@@ i@@ b@@ on@@ ac@@ c@@ i se@@ qu@@ ence that I &apos;m making with a sim@@ ple e@@ qu@@ ation progra@@ m .
Here we have a wor@@ d g@@ ame that &apos;s kind of like a m@@ as@@ h@@ -@@ up between S@@ c@@ r@@ ab@@ ble and B@@ og@@ g@@ le .
B@@ as@@ ically , in every ro@@ und you get a r@@ and@@ om@@ ly assi@@ g@@ ned let@@ ter on each Si@@ ft@@ able , and as you try to make wor@@ ds it ch@@ ec@@ ks ag@@ a@@ in@@ st a dic@@ tion@@ ary .
Th@@ en , after about 30 secon@@ ds , it res@@ hu@@ ff@@ les , and you have a new set of let@@ ters and new possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ties to try .
Thank you .
So these are some kids that came on a fi@@ eld tri@@ p to the Medi@@ a L@@ ab , and I man@@ ag@@ ed to get them to try it out , and sh@@ oo@@ t a vi@@ de@@ o .
They really lo@@ ved it .
And , one of the interesting things about this kind of app@@ lic@@ ation is that you don &apos;t have to give people many in@@ struc@@ tions .
All you have to say is , &quot; Ma@@ ke wor@@ ds , &quot; and they know ex@@ ac@@ tly what to do .
So here &apos;s another few people trying it out .
That &apos;s our y@@ o@@ un@@ ges@@ t bet@@ a t@@ es@@ ter , down there on the right .
T@@ ur@@ ns out , all he wanted to do was to st@@ ack the Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les up .
So to him , they were just blo@@ cks .
Now , this is an inter@@ ac@@ tive car@@ to@@ on app@@ lic@@ ation .
And we wanted to bu@@ ild a lear@@ ning to@@ ol for lan@@ gu@@ age lear@@ n@@ ers .
And this is F@@ e@@ li@@ x , actually .
And he can br@@ ing new char@@ ac@@ ters into the sc@@ ene , just by li@@ f@@ ting the Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les off the t@@ able that have that char@@ ac@@ ter sho@@ wn on them .
Here , he &apos;s br@@ ing@@ ing the su@@ n out .
D@@ avi@@ d M@@ er@@ ri@@ ll : Now he &apos;s br@@ ou@@ ght a tra@@ c@@ tor into the sc@@ ene .
Go@@ od j@@ ob ! Y@@ e@@ ah !
D@@ M : So by s@@ ha@@ king the Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les and p@@ ut@@ ting them next to each other he can make the char@@ ac@@ ters inter@@ act -- V@@ ide@@ o : Wo@@ of !
D@@ M : inv@@ ent@@ ing his own n@@ ar@@ ra@@ tive .
D@@ M : It &apos;s an op@@ en@@ -@@ en@@ ded story , and he ge@@ ts to de@@ ci@@ de how it un@@ fol@@ ds .
D@@ M : So , the last example I have time to show you today is a mus@@ ic se@@ qu@@ en@@ c@@ ing and live per@@ for@@ man@@ ce to@@ ol that we &apos;ve buil@@ t rec@@ ent@@ ly , in which Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les act as so@@ un@@ ds like le@@ ad , b@@ ass and dr@@ um@@ s .
E@@ ach of these has four different v@@ ari@@ ations , you get to cho@@ ose which one you want to use .
And you can in@@ ject these so@@ un@@ ds into a se@@ qu@@ ence that you can ass@@ em@@ ble into the pat@@ tern that you want .
And you in@@ ject it by just b@@ um@@ p@@ ing up the so@@ und Si@@ ft@@ able ag@@ a@@ in@@ st a se@@ qu@@ ence Si@@ ft@@ able .
There are eff@@ ects that you can con@@ tro@@ l live , like re@@ ver@@ b and fil@@ ter .
You at@@ ta@@ ch it to a partic@@ ular so@@ und and then ti@@ lt to ad@@ just it .
And then , o@@ ver@@ all eff@@ ects like tem@@ p@@ o and vol@@ u@@ me that app@@ ly to the enti@@ re se@@ qu@@ ence .
So let &apos;s have a look .
V@@ ide@@ o : D@@ M : We &apos;ll start by p@@ ut@@ ting a le@@ ad into two se@@ qu@@ ence Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les , ar@@ ran@@ ge them into a s@@ eri@@ es , ex@@ t@@ end it , ad@@ d a little more le@@ ad .
Now I put a b@@ ass line in .
V@@ ide@@ o : D@@ M : Now I &apos;ll put some perc@@ us@@ sion in .
V@@ ide@@ o : D@@ M : And now I &apos;ll at@@ ta@@ ch the fil@@ ter to the dr@@ um@@ s , so I can con@@ tro@@ l the eff@@ ect live .
V@@ ide@@ o : D@@ M : I can spe@@ ed up the whole se@@ qu@@ ence by ti@@ l@@ ting the tem@@ p@@ o one way or the other .
V@@ ide@@ o : D@@ M : And now I &apos;ll at@@ ta@@ ch the fil@@ ter to the b@@ ass for some more ex@@ pres@@ sion .
V@@ ide@@ o : D@@ M : I can re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ge the se@@ qu@@ ence whi@@ le it pla@@ ys .
So I don &apos;t have to pl@@ an it out in ad@@ v@@ ance , but I can im@@ pro@@ vis@@ e , making it l@@ on@@ ger or sh@@ or@@ ter as I go .
And now , fin@@ ally , I can fa@@ de the whole se@@ qu@@ ence out using the vol@@ u@@ me Si@@ ft@@ able , ti@@ l@@ ted to the left .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passi@@ on is for making new hum@@ an@@ -@@ compu@@ ter inter@@ fac@@ es that are a better mat@@ ch to the ways our bra@@ ins and bo@@ dies work .
And today , I had time to show you one point in this new design space , and a few of the possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ties that we &apos;re working to br@@ ing out of the l@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ ory .
So the thought I want to lea@@ ve you with is that we &apos;re on the c@@ us@@ p of this new gener@@ ation of to@@ ol@@ s for inter@@ ac@@ ting with dig@@ ital medi@@ a that are going to br@@ ing in@@ formation into our world on our ter@@ ms .
Thank you very much .
I look for@@ ward to talking with all of you .
I am a w@@ ri@@ ter .
W@@ ri@@ ting bo@@ o@@ ks is my pro@@ f@@ es@@ sion but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It is also my great li@@ f@@ el@@ ong love and fas@@ c@@ in@@ ation .
And I don &apos;t exp@@ ect that that &apos;s ever going to change .
But , that said , something kind of p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar has happened rec@@ ent@@ ly in my life and in my car@@ e@@ er , which has c@@ aus@@ ed me to have to rec@@ ali@@ bra@@ te my whole rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p with this work .
And the p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar thing is that I rec@@ ent@@ ly w@@ ro@@ te this book , this mem@@ o@@ ir called &quot; E@@ at , P@@ ra@@ y , L@@ o@@ ve &quot; which , de@@ ci@@ de@@ d@@ ly un@@ like any of my pre@@ vi@@ ous bo@@ o@@ ks , went out in the world for some reas@@ on , and bec@@ ame this big , me@@ ga@@ -@@ sen@@ sa@@ tion , inter@@ n@@ ational bes@@ ts@@ ell@@ er thing .
The res@@ ul@@ t of which is that every@@ where I go now , people tre@@ at me like I &apos;m do@@ om@@ ed .
S@@ eri@@ ous@@ ly -- do@@ om@@ ed , do@@ om@@ ed !
Li@@ ke , they come up to me now , all wor@@ ri@@ ed , and they say , &quot; Ar@@ en &apos;t you a@@ fra@@ id you &apos;re never going to be able to top that ?
Ar@@ en &apos;t you a@@ fra@@ id you &apos;re going to ke@@ ep w@@ ri@@ ting for your whole life and you &apos;re never again going to create a book that any@@ body in the world car@@ es about at all , ever again ? &quot;
So that &apos;s re@@ ass@@ ur@@ ing , you know .
But it would be wor@@ se , ex@@ ce@@ pt for that I happ@@ en to re@@ mem@@ ber that over 20 years ago , when I was a te@@ en@@ ag@@ er , when I first started tell@@ ing people that I wanted to be a w@@ ri@@ ter , I was me@@ t with this same sort of f@@ ear@@ -@@ bas@@ ed re@@ ac@@ tion .
And people would say , &quot; Ar@@ en &apos;t you a@@ fra@@ id you &apos;re never going to have any su@@ c@@ cess ?
Ar@@ en &apos;t you a@@ fra@@ id the hum@@ ili@@ ation of re@@ j@@ ec@@ tion will k@@ il@@ l you ?
Ar@@ en &apos;t you a@@ fra@@ id that you &apos;re going to work your whole life at this cra@@ ft and no@@ thing &apos;s ever going to come of it and you &apos;re going to die on a sc@@ ra@@ p he@@ a@@ p of bro@@ ken dre@@ am@@ s with your m@@ ou@@ th f@@ ill@@ ed with b@@ it@@ ter as@@ h of fa@@ il@@ ure ? &quot;
Li@@ ke that , you know .
The ans@@ wer -- the sh@@ ort ans@@ wer to all those ques@@ tions is , &quot; Y@@ es . &quot;
Y@@ es , I &apos;m a@@ fra@@ id of all those things .
And I always have been .
And I &apos;m a@@ fra@@ id of many , many more things bes@@ i@@ des that people can &apos;t even gu@@ ess at , like se@@ a@@ we@@ ed and other things that are sc@@ ary .
But , when it comes to w@@ ri@@ ting , the thing that I &apos;ve been sort of thinking about l@@ at@@ ely , and w@@ onder@@ ing about l@@ at@@ ely , is why ?
You know , is it ra@@ tional ?
I@@ s it lo@@ gi@@ cal that any@@ body should be exp@@ ec@@ ted to be a@@ fra@@ id of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do .
And what is it spec@@ i@@ f@@ ically about cre@@ ative v@@ ent@@ ur@@ es that se@@ em@@ s to make us really n@@ er@@ v@@ ous about each other &apos;s ment@@ al heal@@ th in a way that other car@@ e@@ ers kind of don &apos;t do , you know ?
Li@@ ke my da@@ d , for example , was a ch@@ em@@ ic@@ al eng@@ in@@ e@@ er and I don &apos;t rec@@ all on@@ ce in his 4@@ 0 years of ch@@ em@@ ic@@ al eng@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ing any@@ body as@@ king him if he was a@@ fra@@ id to be a ch@@ em@@ ic@@ al eng@@ in@@ e@@ er , you know ?
&quot; That ch@@ em@@ ic@@ al@@ -@@ eng@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ing blo@@ ck , J@@ oh@@ n , how &apos;s it going ? &quot;
It just didn &apos;t come up like that , you know ?
But to be fa@@ ir , ch@@ em@@ ic@@ al eng@@ in@@ e@@ ers as a grou@@ p ha@@ ven &apos;t really ear@@ ned a re@@ p@@ ut@@ ation over the cent@@ u@@ ri@@ es for being al@@ co@@ ho@@ li@@ c man@@ ic@@ -@@ de@@ pres@@ si@@ ves .
We w@@ ri@@ ters , we kind of do have that re@@ p@@ ut@@ ation , and not just w@@ ri@@ ters , but cre@@ ative people ac@@ ross all gen@@ r@@ es , it se@@ em@@ s , have this re@@ p@@ ut@@ ation for being en@@ or@@ m@@ ous@@ ly ment@@ ally un@@ st@@ able .
And all you have to do is look at the very g@@ ri@@ m de@@ at@@ h coun@@ t in the 20@@ th cent@@ ur@@ y al@@ one , of really ma@@ g@@ ni@@ f@@ ic@@ ent cre@@ ative min@@ ds who di@@ ed y@@ o@@ ung and o@@ ften at their own hand@@ s , you know ?
And even the ones who didn &apos;t li@@ ter@@ ally com@@ mit su@@ ic@@ i@@ de se@@ em to be really und@@ one by their gi@@ f@@ ts , you know .
N@@ or@@ man Ma@@ il@@ er , just before he di@@ ed , last inter@@ vie@@ w , he said , &quot; E@@ very one of my bo@@ o@@ ks has k@@ ill@@ ed me a little more . &quot;
A@@ n ex@@ tra@@ ord@@ in@@ ary stat@@ em@@ ent to make about your life &apos;s work .
But we don &apos;t even b@@ lin@@ k when we he@@ ar some@@ body say this , because we &apos;ve hear@@ d that kind of stuff for so long and som@@ eh@@ ow we &apos;ve comp@@ let@@ ely inter@@ n@@ ali@@ zed and ac@@ c@@ ep@@ ted col@@ lec@@ tiv@@ ely this no@@ tion that cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity and su@@ ff@@ er@@ ing are som@@ eh@@ ow in@@ her@@ ent@@ ly lin@@ ked and that arti@@ str@@ y , in the end , will always ul@@ ti@@ mat@@ ely le@@ ad to an@@ gu@@ ish .
And the question that I want to ask every@@ body here today is are you gu@@ ys all co@@ ol with that idea ?
A@@ re you com@@ for@@ t@@ able with that ?
Because you look at it even from an in@@ ch away and , you know -- I &apos;m not at all com@@ for@@ t@@ able with that as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion .
I think it &apos;s o@@ di@@ ous .
And I also think it &apos;s dan@@ ger@@ ous , and I don &apos;t want to see it per@@ p@@ et@@ u@@ ated into the next cent@@ ur@@ y .
I think it &apos;s better if we en@@ cou@@ ra@@ ge our great cre@@ ative min@@ ds to live .
And I de@@ fin@@ it@@ ely know that , in my c@@ ase -- in my sit@@ u@@ ation -- it would be very dan@@ ger@@ ous for me to start sort of lea@@ king down that dar@@ k pat@@ h of as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion , partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly gi@@ ven the c@@ ir@@ c@@ um@@ st@@ ance that I &apos;m in right now in my car@@ e@@ er .
Wh@@ ich is -- you know , like ch@@ ec@@ k it out , I &apos;m pretty y@@ o@@ ung , I &apos;m only about 4@@ 0 years old .
I still have maybe another four de@@ c@@ a@@ des of work left in me .
And it &apos;s ex@@ ce@@ e@@ d@@ ing@@ ly li@@ k@@ ely that anything I w@@ ri@@ te from this point for@@ ward is going to be j@@ u@@ d@@ g@@ ed by the world as the work that came after the fre@@ ak@@ ish su@@ c@@ cess of my last book , right ?
I should just put it bl@@ un@@ tly , because we &apos;re all sort of fri@@ ends here now -- it &apos;s ex@@ ce@@ e@@ d@@ ing@@ ly li@@ k@@ ely that my gre@@ at@@ est su@@ c@@ cess is beh@@ ind me .
So J@@ es@@ us , what a thought !
That &apos;s the kind of thought that could le@@ ad a person to start dr@@ in@@ king g@@ in at n@@ ine o &apos;@@ c@@ lo@@ ck in the mor@@ ning , and I don &apos;t want to go there .
I would pre@@ f@@ er to ke@@ ep doing this work that I love .
And so , the question be@@ comes , how ?
And so , it se@@ em@@ s to me , up@@ on a lot of re@@ f@@ lec@@ tion , that the way that I have to work now , in or@@ der to con@@ tin@@ ue w@@ ri@@ ting , is that I have to create some sort of pr@@ ot@@ ec@@ tive p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ologi@@ cal con@@ struc@@ t , right ?
I have to sort of find some way to have a sa@@ fe dis@@ t@@ ance between me , as I am w@@ ri@@ ting , and my very nat@@ ur@@ al an@@ x@@ i@@ et@@ y about what the re@@ ac@@ tion to that w@@ ri@@ ting is going to be , from now on .
And , as I &apos;ve been looking , over the last year , for mo@@ d@@ els for how to do that , I &apos;ve been sort of looking ac@@ ross time , and I &apos;ve been trying to find other soci@@ e@@ ties to see if they might have had better and s@@ an@@ er ideas than we have about how to help cre@@ ative people sort of man@@ age the in@@ her@@ ent em@@ o@@ tional ris@@ ks of cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity .
And that se@@ ar@@ ch has l@@ ed me to an@@ ci@@ ent G@@ re@@ ec@@ e and an@@ ci@@ ent R@@ ome .
So st@@ ay with me , because it does c@@ ir@@ c@@ le around and back .
But , an@@ ci@@ ent G@@ re@@ ec@@ e and an@@ ci@@ ent R@@ ome -- people did not happ@@ en to believe that cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity came from human b@@ ein@@ gs back then , OK ?
P@@ e@@ ople be@@ li@@ ev@@ ed that cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity was this di@@ v@@ ine at@@ ten@@ d@@ ant sp@@ ir@@ it that came to human b@@ ein@@ gs from some dis@@ t@@ ant and unk@@ no@@ w@@ able s@@ our@@ ce , for dis@@ t@@ ant and unk@@ no@@ w@@ able reas@@ ons .
The G@@ re@@ e@@ ks fam@@ ous@@ ly called these di@@ v@@ ine at@@ ten@@ d@@ ant spi@@ ri@@ ts of cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity &quot; da@@ em@@ ons . &quot;
So@@ c@@ r@@ ates , fam@@ ous@@ ly , be@@ li@@ ev@@ ed that he had a da@@ em@@ on who sp@@ o@@ ke wis@@ do@@ m to him from af@@ ar .
The R@@ om@@ ans had the same idea , but they called that sort of dis@@ em@@ bo@@ di@@ ed cre@@ ative sp@@ ir@@ it a gen@@ i@@ us .
Wh@@ ich is great , because the R@@ om@@ ans did not actually think that a gen@@ i@@ us was a partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly cle@@ ver in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al .
They be@@ li@@ ev@@ ed that a gen@@ i@@ us was this , sort of ma@@ gi@@ cal di@@ v@@ ine enti@@ ty , who was be@@ li@@ ev@@ ed to li@@ ter@@ ally live in the w@@ alls of an arti@@ st &apos;s stu@@ di@@ o , kind of like D@@ ob@@ by the h@@ ou@@ se el@@ f , and sort of inv@@ isi@@ b@@ ly ass@@ ist the arti@@ st with their work and would sh@@ ap@@ e the out@@ come of that work .
So bri@@ lli@@ ant -- there it is , right there , that dis@@ t@@ ance that I &apos;m talking about -- that p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ologi@@ cal con@@ struc@@ t to pr@@ ot@@ ect you from the res@@ ul@@ ts of your work .
And every@@ one k@@ new that this is how it f@@ un@@ c@@ tion@@ ed , right ?
So the an@@ ci@@ ent arti@@ st was pr@@ ot@@ ec@@ ted from cer@@ tain things , like , for example , too much n@@ ar@@ c@@ is@@ s@@ is@@ m , right ?
If your work was bri@@ lli@@ ant , you cou@@ ldn &apos;t take all the cre@@ d@@ it for it , every@@ body k@@ new that you had this dis@@ em@@ bo@@ di@@ ed gen@@ i@@ us who had hel@@ p@@ ed you .
If your work b@@ om@@ b@@ ed , not enti@@ r@@ ely your f@@ au@@ lt , you know ?
E@@ very@@ one k@@ new your gen@@ i@@ us was kind of l@@ ame .
And this is how people thought about cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity in the W@@ est for a really long time .
And then the R@@ en@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance came and everything chan@@ g@@ ed , and we had this big idea , and the big idea was , let &apos;s put the in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al human being at the cent@@ er of the uni@@ verse ab@@ o@@ ve all go@@ ds and my@@ st@@ eri@@ es , and there &apos;s no more ro@@ om for my@@ sti@@ cal cre@@ at@@ ur@@ es who take dic@@ ta@@ tion from the di@@ v@@ ine .
And it &apos;s the beg@@ inn@@ ing of ra@@ tional hum@@ an@@ is@@ m , and people started to believe that cre@@ ati@@ v@@ ity came comp@@ let@@ ely from the self of the in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al .
And for the first time in hist@@ ory , you start to he@@ ar people re@@ fer@@ r@@ ing to this or that arti@@ st as being a gen@@ i@@ us , ra@@ ther than ha@@ ving a gen@@ i@@ us .
And I got to tell you , I think that was a hu@@ ge er@@ ro@@ r .
You know , I think that al@@ lo@@ wing some@@ body , one m@@ ere person to believe that he or she is like , the v@@ es@@ se@@ l , you know , like the f@@ on@@ t and the ess@@ ence and the s@@ our@@ ce of all di@@ v@@ ine , cre@@ ative , unk@@ no@@ w@@ able , e@@ ter@@ n@@ al my@@ ster@@ y is just a s@@ mi@@ dge too much res@@ pon@@ si@@ bi@@ li@@ ty to put on one fra@@ gi@@ le , human p@@ sy@@ che .
It &apos;s like as@@ king some@@ body to s@@ w@@ al@@ low the su@@ n .
It just comp@@ let@@ ely war@@ ps and dis@@ t@@ or@@ ts e@@ go@@ s , and it cre@@ ates all these un@@ man@@ a@@ ge@@ able exp@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions about per@@ for@@ man@@ ce .
And I think the pres@@ s@@ ure of that has been k@@ ill@@ ing off our arti@@ st@@ s for the last 5@@ 00 years .
And , if this is tr@@ ue , and I think it is tr@@ ue , the question be@@ comes , what now ?
C@@ an we do this differ@@ ent@@ ly ?
Ma@@ ybe go back to some more an@@ ci@@ ent under@@ stand@@ ing about the rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p between hum@@ ans and the cre@@ ative my@@ ster@@ y .
Ma@@ ybe not .
Ma@@ ybe we can &apos;t just er@@ ase 5@@ 00 years of ra@@ tional hum@@ an@@ is@@ tic thought in one 1@@ 8 min@@ ute spe@@ e@@ ch .
And there &apos;s probably people in this au@@ di@@ ence who would ra@@ is@@ e really le@@ gi@@ ti@@ ma@@ te sci@@ enti@@ fi@@ c s@@ us@@ pic@@ i@@ ons about the no@@ tion of , bas@@ ically , fa@@ i@@ ri@@ es who fol@@ low people around ru@@ b@@ b@@ ing fa@@ ir@@ y j@@ u@@ ice on their pro@@ j@@ ects and stuff .
I &apos;m not , probably , going to br@@ ing you all al@@ ong with me on this .
But the question that I kind of want to p@@ ose is -- you know , why not ?
Wh@@ y not think about it this way ?
Because it ma@@ kes as much sense as anything el@@ se I have ever hear@@ d in ter@@ ms of ex@@ pla@@ in@@ ing the ut@@ ter ma@@ d@@ den@@ ing cap@@ ri@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness of the cre@@ ative pro@@ cess .
A pro@@ cess which , as any@@ body who has ever tri@@ ed to make something -- which is to say bas@@ ically every@@ one here -@@ -- kno@@ ws does not always beh@@ a@@ ve ra@@ tion@@ ally .
And , in fact , can some@@ times feel do@@ w@@ n@@ right par@@ an@@ or@@ mal .
I had this en@@ coun@@ ter rec@@ ent@@ ly where I me@@ t the ex@@ tra@@ ord@@ in@@ ary Ameri@@ can po@@ et R@@ u@@ th St@@ one , who &apos;s now in her 9@@ 0@@ s , but she &apos;s been a po@@ et her enti@@ re life and she t@@ old me that when she was gro@@ wing up in r@@ ur@@ al V@@ ir@@ g@@ ini@@ a , she would be out working in the fi@@ el@@ ds , and she said she would feel and he@@ ar a po@@ em coming at her from over the l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e .
And she said it was like a th@@ under@@ ous tra@@ in of a@@ ir .
And it would come bar@@ rel@@ ing down at her over the l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e .
And she f@@ elt it coming , because it would s@@ ha@@ ke the ear@@ th un@@ der her fe@@ et .
S@@ he k@@ new that she had only one thing to do at that point , and that was to , in her wor@@ ds , &quot; ru@@ n like h@@ ell . &quot;
And she would ru@@ n like h@@ ell to the h@@ ou@@ se and she would be getting ch@@ as@@ ed by this po@@ em , and the whole de@@ al was that she had to get to a piec@@ e of p@@ ap@@ er and a p@@ en@@ ci@@ l fast enough so that when it th@@ under@@ ed through her , she could col@@ lec@@ t it and gra@@ b it on the pa@@ ge .
And other times she w@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t be fast enough , so she &apos;d be r@@ un@@ ning and r@@ un@@ ning , and she w@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t get to the h@@ ou@@ se and the po@@ em would bar@@ re@@ l through her and she would mis@@ s it and she said it would con@@ tin@@ ue on ac@@ ross the l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e , looking , as she put it &quot; for another po@@ et . &quot;
And then there were these times -- this is the piec@@ e I never for@@ got -- she said that there were m@@ om@@ ents where she would al@@ most mis@@ s it , right ?
So , she &apos;s r@@ un@@ ning to the h@@ ou@@ se and she &apos;s looking for the p@@ ap@@ er and the po@@ em p@@ ass@@ es through her , and she gr@@ ab@@ s a p@@ en@@ ci@@ l just as it &apos;s going through her , and then she said , it was like she would re@@ ach out with her other h@@ and and she would c@@ at@@ ch it .
S@@ he would c@@ at@@ ch the po@@ em by its ta@@ il , and she would p@@ ul@@ l it b@@ ack@@ war@@ ds into her body as she was tr@@ an@@ scri@@ b@@ ing on the pa@@ ge .
And in these in@@ st@@ an@@ ces , the po@@ em would come up on the pa@@ ge per@@ f@@ ect and in@@ t@@ act but b@@ ack@@ war@@ ds , from the last wor@@ d to the first .
So when I hear@@ d that I was like -- that &apos;s un@@ can@@ n@@ y , that &apos;s ex@@ ac@@ tly what my cre@@ ative pro@@ cess is like .
That &apos;s not at all what my cre@@ ative pro@@ cess is -- I &apos;m not the pi@@ p@@ el@@ ine !
I &apos;m a m@@ u@@ le , and the way that I have to work is I have to get up at the same time every day , and s@@ we@@ at and l@@ ab@@ or and bar@@ re@@ l through it really a@@ w@@ k@@ war@@ d@@ ly .
But even I , in my m@@ u@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , even I have br@@ us@@ h@@ ed up ag@@ a@@ in@@ st that thing , at times .
And I would ima@@ g@@ ine that a lot of you have too .
You know , even I have had work or ideas come through me from a s@@ our@@ ce that I h@@ on@@ est@@ ly can@@ not i@@ den@@ ti@@ f@@ y .
And what is that thing ?
And how are we to rel@@ ate to it in a way that will not make us l@@ ose our min@@ ds , but , in fact , might actually ke@@ ep us s@@ an@@ e ?
And for me , the best con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary example that I have of how to do that is the mus@@ ic@@ i@@ an T@@ om W@@ a@@ its , who I got to inter@@ vie@@ w se@@ ver@@ al years ago on a ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine assi@@ g@@ n@@ ment .
And we were talking about this , and you know , T@@ om , for most of his life , he was pretty much the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of the t@@ or@@ ment@@ ed con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary mo@@ dern arti@@ st , trying to con@@ tro@@ l and man@@ age and d@@ om@@ in@@ ate these sort of un@@ con@@ tro@@ ll@@ able cre@@ ative imp@@ ul@@ s@@ es that were t@@ ot@@ ally inter@@ n@@ ali@@ zed .
But then he got ol@@ der , he got c@@ al@@ mer , and one day he was dri@@ ving down the fre@@ e@@ way in L@@ os An@@ gel@@ es , and this is when it all chan@@ g@@ ed for him .
And he &apos;s spe@@ e@@ ding al@@ ong , and all of a su@@ d@@ den he hear@@ s this little fra@@ g@@ ment of m@@ el@@ o@@ dy , that comes into his he@@ ad as in@@ spi@@ ra@@ tion o@@ ften comes , el@@ usi@@ ve and t@@ an@@ tal@@ i@@ zing , and he wan@@ ts it , it &apos;s g@@ or@@ ge@@ ous , and he l@@ on@@ gs for it , but he has no way to get it .
He doesn &apos;t have a piec@@ e of p@@ ap@@ er , or a p@@ en@@ ci@@ l , or a t@@ ap@@ e rec@@ or@@ der .
So he star@@ ts to feel all of that old an@@ x@@ i@@ et@@ y start to ris@@ e in him like , &quot; I &apos;m going to l@@ ose this thing , and I &apos;ll be be ha@@ un@@ ted by this s@@ ong for@@ ever .
I &apos;m not good enough , and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And in@@ ste@@ ad of p@@ ani@@ ck@@ ing , he just st@@ op@@ p@@ ed .
He just st@@ op@@ p@@ ed that whole ment@@ al pro@@ cess and he did something comp@@ let@@ ely nov@@ el .
He just loo@@ ked up at the sk@@ y , and he said , &quot; Ex@@ c@@ use me , can you not see that I &apos;m dri@@ ving ? &quot;
&quot; D@@ o I look like I can w@@ ri@@ te down a s@@ ong right now ?
If you really want to ex@@ ist , come back at a more op@@ port@@ un@@ e m@@ oment when I can take c@@ are of you .
O@@ ther@@ wis@@ e , go bo@@ ther some@@ body el@@ se today .
G@@ o bo@@ ther Le@@ on@@ ard C@@ oh@@ en . &quot;
And his whole work pro@@ cess chan@@ g@@ ed after that .
N@@ ot the work , the work was still o@@ f@@ ten@@ times as dar@@ k as ever .
But the pro@@ cess , and the he@@ av@@ y an@@ x@@ i@@ et@@ y around it was rel@@ eas@@ ed when he took the gen@@ ie , the gen@@ i@@ us out of him where it was c@@ aus@@ ing no@@ thing but tr@@ ou@@ ble , and rel@@ eas@@ ed it back where it came from , and re@@ ali@@ zed that this didn &apos;t have to be this inter@@ n@@ ali@@ zed , t@@ or@@ ment@@ ed thing .
It could be this p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar , w@@ on@@ dr@@ ous , bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re c@@ oll@@ ab@@ or@@ ation , kind of con@@ ver@@ sa@@ tion between T@@ om and the st@@ ran@@ ge , ex@@ ter@@ n@@ al thing that was not quite T@@ om .
When I hear@@ d that story , it started to shi@@ ft a little bit the way that I wor@@ ked too , and this idea al@@ ready sa@@ ved me on@@ ce .
It sa@@ ved me when I was in the mi@@ dd@@ le of w@@ ri@@ ting &quot; E@@ at , P@@ ra@@ y , L@@ o@@ ve , &quot; and I f@@ ell into one of those sort of p@@ its of des@@ pa@@ ir that we all f@@ all into when we &apos;re working on something and it &apos;s not coming and you start to think this is going to be a dis@@ a@@ ster , the wor@@ st book ever w@@ rit@@ ten .
N@@ ot just b@@ ad , but the wor@@ st book ever w@@ rit@@ ten .
And I started to think I should just d@@ um@@ p this pro@@ ject .
But then I re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed T@@ om talking to the op@@ en a@@ ir and I tri@@ ed it .
So I just li@@ f@@ ted my face up from the man@@ us@@ cri@@ pt and I di@@ rec@@ ted my comm@@ ents to an em@@ p@@ ty cor@@ ner of the ro@@ om .
And I said al@@ ou@@ d , &quot; L@@ is@@ ten you , thing , you and I bot@@ h know that if this book is@@ n &apos;t bri@@ lli@@ ant that is not enti@@ r@@ ely my f@@ au@@ lt , right ?
Because you can see that I am p@@ ut@@ ting everything I have into this , I don &apos;t have any more than this .
If you want it to be better , you &apos;ve got to show up and do your part of the de@@ al .
But if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , the h@@ ell with it .
I &apos;m going to ke@@ ep w@@ ri@@ ting any@@ way because that &apos;s my j@@ ob .
And I would ple@@ ase like the rec@@ or@@ d to re@@ f@@ lec@@ t today that I sho@@ w@@ ed up for my part of the j@@ ob . &quot;
Because -- Because in the end it &apos;s like this , OK -- cent@@ u@@ ri@@ es ago in the des@@ er@@ ts of N@@ or@@ th Africa , people used to ga@@ ther for these mo@@ on@@ light dan@@ ces of s@@ ac@@ red dan@@ ce and mus@@ ic that would go on for h@@ our@@ s and h@@ our@@ s , un@@ ti@@ l da@@ wn .
They were always ma@@ g@@ ni@@ f@@ ic@@ ent , because the dan@@ c@@ ers were pro@@ f@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ als and they were ter@@ ri@@ fi@@ c , right ?
But every on@@ ce in a whi@@ le , very r@@ ar@@ ely , something would happ@@ en , and one of these per@@ for@@ m@@ ers would actually be@@ come tr@@ an@@ sc@@ end@@ ent .
And I know you know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you &apos;ve all se@@ en , at some point in your life , a per@@ for@@ man@@ ce like this .
It was like time would sto@@ p , and the dan@@ c@@ er would sort of ste@@ p through some kind of port@@ al and he w@@ as@@ n &apos;t doing anything different than he had ever done , 1@@ ,000 ni@@ gh@@ ts before , but everything would al@@ ig@@ n .
And all of a su@@ d@@ den , he would no l@@ on@@ ger ap@@ pe@@ ar to be mer@@ ely human .
He would be li@@ t from with@@ in , and li@@ t from bel@@ ow and all li@@ t up on fir@@ e with di@@ v@@ in@@ ity .
And when this happened , back then , people k@@ new it for what it was , you know , they called it by its n@@ ame .
They would put their hand@@ s together and they would start to ch@@ ant , &quot; Al@@ la@@ h , Al@@ la@@ h , Al@@ la@@ h , G@@ od , G@@ od , G@@ od . &quot;
That &apos;s G@@ od , you know .
C@@ u@@ ri@@ ous hist@@ or@@ ic@@ al fo@@ ot@@ no@@ te : when the Mo@@ ors inv@@ ad@@ ed s@@ ou@@ th@@ ern S@@ pa@@ in , they took this c@@ u@@ st@@ om with them and the pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation chan@@ g@@ ed over the cent@@ u@@ ri@@ es from &quot; Al@@ la@@ h , Al@@ la@@ h , Al@@ la@@ h , &quot; to &quot; O@@ l@@ é , ol@@ é , ol@@ é , &quot; which you still he@@ ar in b@@ ul@@ l@@ fi@@ gh@@ ts and in fl@@ am@@ en@@ c@@ o dan@@ ces .
In S@@ pa@@ in , when a per@@ for@@ mer has done something im@@ possible and ma@@ gi@@ c , &quot; Al@@ la@@ h , ol@@ é , ol@@ é , Al@@ la@@ h , ma@@ g@@ ni@@ f@@ ic@@ ent , bra@@ v@@ o , &quot; in@@ comp@@ re@@ h@@ ensi@@ ble , there it is -- a g@@ li@@ mp@@ se of G@@ od .
Wh@@ ich is great , because we need that .
But , the tri@@ ck@@ y bit comes the next mor@@ ning , for the dan@@ c@@ er hi@@ m@@ self , when he w@@ ak@@ es up and dis@@ co@@ ver@@ s that it &apos;s T@@ u@@ es@@ day at 1@@ 1 a@@ .@@ m@@ . , and he &apos;s no l@@ on@@ ger a g@@ li@@ mp@@ se of G@@ od .
He &apos;s just an ag@@ ing mor@@ t@@ al with really b@@ ad k@@ ne@@ es , and maybe he &apos;s never going to as@@ c@@ end to that hei@@ ght again .
And maybe no@@ body will ever ch@@ ant G@@ od &apos;s n@@ ame again as he sp@@ ins , and what is he then to do with the res@@ t of his life ?
This is har@@ d .
This is one of the most pa@@ in@@ ful re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ations to make in a cre@@ ative life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be quite so f@@ ul@@ l of an@@ gu@@ ish if you never happened to believe , in the first place , that the most ex@@ tra@@ ord@@ in@@ ary as@@ p@@ ects of your being came from you .
But maybe if you just be@@ li@@ ev@@ ed that they were on lo@@ an to you from some uni@@ ma@@ g@@ in@@ able s@@ our@@ ce for some ex@@ qu@@ isi@@ te por@@ tion of your life to be p@@ ass@@ ed al@@ ong when you &apos;re fin@@ is@@ h@@ ed , with some@@ body el@@ se .
And , you know , if we think about it this way , it star@@ ts to change everything .
This is how I &apos;ve started to think , and this is cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly how I &apos;ve been thinking in the last few mon@@ ths as I &apos;ve been working on the book that will so@@ on be publi@@ sh@@ ed , as the dan@@ ger@@ ous@@ ly , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ing@@ ly o@@ ver@@ -@@ an@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated fol@@ low up to my fre@@ ak@@ ish su@@ c@@ cess .
And what I have to sort of ke@@ ep tell@@ ing my@@ self when I get really p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ed out about that is don &apos;t be a@@ fra@@ id .
D@@ on &apos;t be da@@ un@@ ted . J@@ ust do your j@@ ob .

If the di@@ v@@ ine , co@@ ck@@ e@@ y@@ ed gen@@ i@@ us assi@@ g@@ ned to your c@@ ase de@@ ci@@ des to let some sort of w@@ onder@@ ment be g@@ li@@ mp@@ s@@ ed , for just one m@@ oment through your eff@@ or@@ ts , then &quot; O@@ l@@ é ! &quot;
And if not , do your dan@@ ce any@@ how .
And &quot; O@@ l@@ é ! &quot; to you , n@@ on@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ ess .
I believe this and I feel that we m@@ ust te@@ ach it .
&quot; O@@ l@@ é ! &quot; to you , n@@ on@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ ess , just for ha@@ ving the sh@@ e@@ er human love and st@@ ub@@ bor@@ n@@ ness to ke@@ ep sho@@ wing up .
Thank you .
Thank you .
J@@ un@@ e C@@ oh@@ en : O@@ l@@ é !
You know , I &apos;ve tal@@ ked about some of these pro@@ j@@ ects before -- about the human gen@@ ome and what that might mean , and dis@@ co@@ ver@@ ing new s@@ ets of gen@@ es .
We &apos;re actually star@@ ting at a new point : we &apos;ve been di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing bi@@ olog@@ y , and now we &apos;re trying to go from that dig@@ ital co@@ de into a new ph@@ ase of bi@@ olog@@ y with desig@@ ning and sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ i@@ zing life .
So , we &apos;ve always been trying to ask big ques@@ tions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; is something that I think many bi@@ olog@@ is@@ ts have been trying to understand at v@@ ari@@ ous le@@ vel@@ s .
We &apos;ve tri@@ ed v@@ ari@@ ous ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ es , par@@ ing it down to min@@ i@@ mal comp@@ on@@ ents .
We &apos;ve been di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing it now for al@@ most 20 years ; when we se@@ qu@@ en@@ c@@ ed the human gen@@ ome , it was going from the an@@ al@@ o@@ g world of bi@@ olog@@ y into the dig@@ ital world of the compu@@ ter .
Now we &apos;re trying to ask , &quot; C@@ an we re@@ gener@@ ate life or can we create new life out of this dig@@ ital uni@@ verse ? &quot;
This is the ma@@ p of a small organ@@ is@@ m , M@@ y@@ c@@ op@@ l@@ as@@ ma gen@@ it@@ ali@@ um , that has the sm@@ all@@ est gen@@ ome for a spec@@ ies that can sel@@ f@@ -@@ re@@ p@@ lic@@ ate in the l@@ ab@@ or@@ at@@ ory , and we &apos;ve been trying to just see if we can come up with an even sm@@ all@@ er gen@@ ome .
We &apos;re able to kno@@ ck out on the or@@ der of 100 gen@@ es out of the 5@@ 00 or so that are here .
When we look at its m@@ et@@ ab@@ o@@ li@@ c ma@@ p , it &apos;s rel@@ ati@@ v@@ ely sim@@ ple com@@ par@@ ed to our@@ s -- tr@@ ust me , this is sim@@ ple -- but when we look at all the gen@@ es that we can kno@@ ck out one at a time , it &apos;s very un@@ li@@ k@@ ely that this would y@@ i@@ eld a li@@ ving c@@ ell .
So we de@@ ci@@ ded the only way for@@ ward was to actually sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ i@@ ze this ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome so we could v@@ ary the comp@@ on@@ ents to ask some of these most f@@ und@@ am@@ ent@@ al ques@@ tions .
And so we started down the ro@@ ad of : can we sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ i@@ ze a ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome ?
C@@ an ch@@ em@@ is@@ try per@@ mit making these really lar@@ ge m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ul@@ es where we &apos;ve never been before ?
And if we do , can we bo@@ ot up a ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome ?
A ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome , by the way , is just a piec@@ e of in@@ ert ch@@ em@@ ic@@ al mat@@ eri@@ al .
So , our p@@ ace of di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing life has been incre@@ as@@ ing at an exp@@ on@@ enti@@ al p@@ ace .
O@@ ur abili@@ ty to w@@ ri@@ te the gen@@ e@@ tic co@@ de has been mo@@ ving pretty s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly but has been incre@@ as@@ ing , and our l@@ at@@ est point would put it on , now , an exp@@ on@@ enti@@ al cur@@ ve .
We started this over 15 years ago .
It took se@@ ver@@ al st@@ ag@@ es , in fact , star@@ ting with a bi@@ o@@ e@@ th@@ ic@@ al re@@ vie@@ w before we did the first exper@@ im@@ ents .
But it tur@@ ns out sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ i@@ zing D@@ N@@ A is very diff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t .
There are ten@@ s of thou@@ s@@ and@@ s of ma@@ ch@@ in@@ es around the world that make small piec@@ es of D@@ N@@ A -- 30 to 50 let@@ ters in l@@ eng@@ th -- and it &apos;s a de@@ gener@@ ate pro@@ cess , so the l@@ on@@ ger you make the piec@@ e , the more er@@ r@@ ors there are .
So we had to create a new me@@ th@@ od for p@@ ut@@ ting these little piec@@ es together and cor@@ rec@@ t all the er@@ r@@ ors .
And this was our first att@@ em@@ pt , star@@ ting with the dig@@ ital in@@ formation of the gen@@ ome of ph@@ i X@@ 1@@ 7@@ 4 .
It &apos;s a small vir@@ us that k@@ ill@@ s b@@ ac@@ teri@@ a .
We desig@@ ned the piec@@ es , went through our er@@ ro@@ r cor@@ rec@@ tion and had a D@@ N@@ A m@@ ol@@ ec@@ u@@ le of about 5@@ ,000 let@@ ters .
The ex@@ c@@ it@@ ing ph@@ ase came when we took this piec@@ e of in@@ ert ch@@ em@@ ic@@ al and put it in the b@@ ac@@ teri@@ a , and the b@@ ac@@ teri@@ a started to re@@ ad this gen@@ e@@ tic co@@ de , made the vi@@ ra@@ l partic@@ les .
The vi@@ ra@@ l partic@@ les then were rel@@ eas@@ ed from the c@@ ell@@ s and came back and k@@ ill@@ ed the E@@ . col@@ i .
I was talking to the o@@ il in@@ du@@ str@@ y rec@@ ent@@ ly and I said they c@@ lear@@ ly under@@ sto@@ od that mo@@ del .
They lau@@ gh@@ ed more than you gu@@ ys are . And so , we think this is a sit@@ u@@ ation where the so@@ ft@@ w@@ are can actually bu@@ ild its own har@@ d@@ w@@ are in a bi@@ ologi@@ cal system .
But we wanted to go much lar@@ ger : we wanted to bu@@ ild the enti@@ re b@@ ac@@ teri@@ al ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome -- it &apos;s over 5@@ 8@@ 0@@ ,000 let@@ ters of gen@@ e@@ tic co@@ de -- so we thought we &apos;d bu@@ ild them in c@@ ass@@ et@@ tes the si@@ ze of the vir@@ us@@ es so we could actually v@@ ary the c@@ ass@@ et@@ tes to understand what the ac@@ tu@@ al comp@@ on@@ ents of a li@@ ving c@@ ell are .
Desig@@ n is cri@@ tical , and if you &apos;re star@@ ting with dig@@ ital in@@ formation in the compu@@ ter , that dig@@ ital in@@ formation has to be really ac@@ cur@@ ate .
When we first se@@ qu@@ en@@ c@@ ed this gen@@ ome in 19@@ 9@@ 5 , the stand@@ ard of ac@@ cur@@ ac@@ y was one er@@ ro@@ r per 10@@ ,000 b@@ ase pa@@ ir@@ s .
We actually found , on res@@ e@@ qu@@ en@@ c@@ ing it , 30 er@@ r@@ ors ; had we used that or@@ ig@@ in@@ al se@@ qu@@ ence , it never would have been able to be bo@@ ot@@ ed up .
Par@@ t of the design is desig@@ ning piec@@ es that are 50 let@@ ters long that have to o@@ ver@@ la@@ p with all the other 5@@ 0@@ -@@ let@@ ter piec@@ es to bu@@ ild sm@@ all@@ er sub@@ un@@ its we have to design so they can go together .
We design uni@@ qu@@ e el@@ em@@ ents into this .
You may have re@@ ad that we put wat@@ er@@ mar@@ ks in .
Th@@ in@@ k of this : we have a f@@ our@@ -@@ let@@ ter gen@@ e@@ tic co@@ de -- A , C , G and T .
T@@ ri@@ ple@@ ts of those let@@ ters co@@ de for r@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly 20 am@@ in@@ o ac@@ i@@ ds , such that there &apos;s a s@@ ing@@ le let@@ ter desig@@ n@@ ation for each of the am@@ in@@ o ac@@ i@@ ds .
So we can use the gen@@ e@@ tic co@@ de to w@@ ri@@ te out wor@@ ds , s@@ ent@@ en@@ ces , thou@@ gh@@ ts .
I@@ ni@@ ti@@ ally , all we did was au@@ to@@ gr@@ ap@@ h it .
S@@ ome people were dis@@ ap@@ po@@ in@@ ted there was not po@@ et@@ ry .
We desig@@ ned these piec@@ es so we can just ch@@ e@@ w back with en@@ z@@ y@@ m@@ es ; there are en@@ z@@ y@@ m@@ es that re@@ pa@@ ir them and put them together .
And we started making piec@@ es , star@@ ting with piec@@ es that were 5@@ ,000 to 7@@ ,000 let@@ ters , put those together to make 2@@ 4@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ let@@ ter piec@@ es , then put s@@ ets of those going up to 7@@ 2@@ ,000 .
A@@ t each st@@ age , we gre@@ w up these piec@@ es in ab@@ und@@ ance so we could se@@ qu@@ ence them because we &apos;re trying to create a pro@@ cess that &apos;s ex@@ tre@@ m@@ ely ro@@ b@@ ust that you can see in a min@@ ute .
We &apos;re trying to get to the point of au@@ t@@ om@@ ation .
So , this loo@@ ks like a bas@@ k@@ et@@ b@@ all pla@@ y@@ off .
When we get into these really lar@@ ge piec@@ es over 10@@ 0@@ ,000 b@@ ase pa@@ ir@@ s , they w@@ on &apos;t any l@@ on@@ ger gro@@ w re@@ a@@ di@@ ly in E@@ . col@@ i -- it ex@@ h@@ au@@ st@@ s all the mo@@ dern to@@ ol@@ s of m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ular bi@@ olog@@ y -- and so we tur@@ ned to other me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms .
We k@@ new there &apos;s a me@@ chan@@ is@@ m called h@@ om@@ olog@@ ous re@@ com@@ bin@@ ation that bi@@ olog@@ y us@@ es to re@@ pa@@ ir D@@ N@@ A that can put piec@@ es together .
Here &apos;s an example of it : there &apos;s an organ@@ is@@ m called D@@ ein@@ o@@ co@@ c@@ c@@ us ra@@ di@@ o@@ dur@@ ans that can take three m@@ illi@@ ons ra@@ ds of ra@@ di@@ ation .
You can see in the top p@@ an@@ el , its ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome just ge@@ ts blo@@ wn ap@@ art .
T@@ wel@@ ve to 2@@ 4 h@@ our@@ s l@@ ater , it put it back together ex@@ ac@@ tly as it was before .
We have thou@@ s@@ and@@ s of organ@@ is@@ ms that can do this .
These organ@@ is@@ ms can be t@@ ot@@ ally des@@ ic@@ c@@ ated ; they can live in a v@@ ac@@ u@@ um .
I am ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely cer@@ tain that life can ex@@ ist in ou@@ ter space , mo@@ ve around , find a new a@@ qu@@ e@@ ous en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment .
In fact , N@@ A@@ SA has sho@@ wn a lot of this is out there .
Here &apos;s an ac@@ tu@@ al m@@ ic@@ ro@@ gr@@ ap@@ h of the m@@ ol@@ ec@@ u@@ le we buil@@ t using these pro@@ c@@ ess@@ es , actually just using ye@@ ast me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms with the right design of the piec@@ es we put them in ; ye@@ ast pu@@ ts them together au@@ t@@ om@@ ati@@ c@@ ally .
This is not an elec@@ tr@@ on m@@ ic@@ ro@@ gr@@ ap@@ h ; this is just a re@@ g@@ ular ph@@ ot@@ om@@ ic@@ ro@@ gr@@ ap@@ h .
It &apos;s such a lar@@ ge m@@ ol@@ ec@@ u@@ le we can see it with a light m@@ ic@@ ros@@ c@@ op@@ e .
These are pic@@ tur@@ es over about a si@@ x@@ -@@ second per@@ i@@ od .
So , this is the p@@ ub@@ lic@@ ation we had just a sh@@ ort whi@@ le ago .
This is over 5@@ 8@@ 0@@ ,000 let@@ ters of gen@@ e@@ tic co@@ de ; it &apos;s the lar@@ ges@@ t m@@ ol@@ ec@@ u@@ le ever made by hum@@ ans of a de@@ fin@@ ed struc@@ ture .
It &apos;s over 3@@ 00 million m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ular wei@@ ght .
If we pr@@ in@@ ted it out at a 10 f@@ on@@ t with no sp@@ ac@@ ing , it ta@@ kes 1@@ 4@@ 2 p@@ ag@@ es just to pr@@ int this gen@@ e@@ tic co@@ de .
Well , how do we bo@@ ot up a ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome ? How do we ac@@ tiv@@ ate this ?
Ob@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly , with a vir@@ us it &apos;s pretty sim@@ ple ; it &apos;s much more comp@@ lic@@ ated de@@ al@@ ing with b@@ ac@@ teri@@ a .
It &apos;s also sim@@ pl@@ er when you go into eu@@ k@@ ar@@ y@@ ot@@ es like our@@ selves : you can just po@@ p out the n@@ u@@ cle@@ us and po@@ p in another one , and that &apos;s what you &apos;ve all hear@@ d about with cl@@ on@@ ing .
W@@ it@@ h b@@ ac@@ teri@@ a and Ar@@ ch@@ a@@ e@@ a , the ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome is in@@ te@@ gr@@ ated into the c@@ ell , but we rec@@ ent@@ ly sho@@ w@@ ed that we can do a comp@@ le@@ te tr@@ an@@ sp@@ l@@ ant of a ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome from one c@@ ell to another and ac@@ tiv@@ ate it .
We pu@@ ri@@ fi@@ ed a ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome from one m@@ ic@@ ro@@ bi@@ al spec@@ ies -- r@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly , these two are as dis@@ t@@ ant as human and mi@@ ce -- we ad@@ ded a few ex@@ tr@@ a gen@@ es so we could sel@@ ect for this ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome , we di@@ ges@@ ted it with en@@ z@@ y@@ m@@ es to k@@ il@@ l all the pr@@ ot@@ ein@@ s , and it was pretty st@@ un@@ ning when we put this in the c@@ ell -- and you &apos;ll app@@ re@@ ci@@ ate our very s@@ op@@ h@@ is@@ tic@@ ated gr@@ ap@@ hi@@ c@@ s here .
The new ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome went into the c@@ ell .
In fact , we thought this might be as f@@ ar as it went , but we tri@@ ed to design the pro@@ cess a little bit f@@ ur@@ ther .
This is a ma@@ j@@ or me@@ chan@@ is@@ m of evol@@ ution right here .
We find all kin@@ ds of spec@@ ies that have ta@@ ken up a second ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome or a th@@ ir@@ d one from some@@ where , ad@@ ding thou@@ s@@ and@@ s of new tra@@ its in a second to that spec@@ ies .
So , people who think of evol@@ ution as just one gen@@ e chan@@ ging at a time have mis@@ s@@ ed much of bi@@ olog@@ y .
There are en@@ z@@ y@@ m@@ es called res@@ tri@@ c@@ tion en@@ z@@ y@@ m@@ es that actually di@@ ges@@ t D@@ N@@ A .
The ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome that was in the c@@ ell doesn &apos;t have one ; the ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome we put in does .
It got ex@@ pres@@ s@@ ed and it rec@@ og@@ ni@@ zed the other ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome as for@@ ei@@ g@@ n mat@@ eri@@ al , ch@@ e@@ w@@ ed it up , and so we en@@ ded up just with a c@@ ell with the new ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome .
It tur@@ ned b@@ lu@@ e because of the gen@@ es we put in it .
And with a very sh@@ ort per@@ i@@ od of time , all the char@@ ac@@ ter@@ is@@ tic@@ s of one spec@@ ies were l@@ ost and it con@@ ver@@ ted t@@ ot@@ ally into the new spec@@ ies bas@@ ed on the new so@@ ft@@ w@@ are that we put in the c@@ ell .
All the pr@@ ot@@ ein@@ s chan@@ g@@ ed , the mem@@ br@@ an@@ es chan@@ g@@ ed ; when we re@@ ad the gen@@ e@@ tic co@@ de , it &apos;s ex@@ ac@@ tly what we had trans@@ fer@@ red in .
So , this may so@@ und like gen@@ om@@ ic al@@ ch@@ em@@ y , but we can , by mo@@ ving the so@@ ft@@ w@@ are of D@@ N@@ A around , change things quite dra@@ ma@@ tic@@ ally .
Now I &apos;ve ar@@ gu@@ ed , this is not gen@@ es@@ is ; this is building on three and a hal@@ f b@@ illion years of evol@@ ution .
And I &apos;ve ar@@ gu@@ ed that we &apos;re about to per@@ h@@ ap@@ s create a new ver@@ sion of the C@@ am@@ bri@@ an ex@@ pl@@ os@@ i@@ on , where there &apos;s m@@ assi@@ ve new spec@@ i@@ ation bas@@ ed on this dig@@ ital design .
Wh@@ y do this ?
I think this is pretty ob@@ vi@@ ous in ter@@ ms of some of the nee@@ ds .
We &apos;re about to go from si@@ x and a hal@@ f to n@@ ine b@@ illion people over the next 4@@ 0 years .
T@@ o put it in con@@ te@@ xt for my@@ self : I was bor@@ n in 19@@ 4@@ 6 .
There are now three people on the planet for every one of us that ex@@ is@@ ted in 19@@ 4@@ 6 ; with@@ in 4@@ 0 years , there &apos;ll be four .
We have tr@@ ou@@ ble fe@@ e@@ ding , pro@@ vi@@ ding f@@ res@@ h , cle@@ an water , medi@@ c@@ in@@ es , fu@@ el for the si@@ x and a hal@@ f b@@ illion .
It &apos;s going to be a stre@@ t@@ ch to do it for n@@ ine .
We use over five b@@ illion t@@ ons of co@@ al , 30 b@@ illi@@ on@@ -@@ pl@@ us bar@@ rel@@ s of o@@ il -- that &apos;s a h@@ und@@ red million bar@@ rel@@ s a day .
When we try to think of bi@@ ologi@@ cal pro@@ c@@ ess@@ es or any pro@@ cess to re@@ place that , it &apos;s going to be a hu@@ ge ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge .
Th@@ en of course , there &apos;s all that C@@ O@@ 2 from this mat@@ eri@@ al that ends up in the at@@ mos@@ p@@ here .
We now , from our dis@@ co@@ very around the world , have a dat@@ ab@@ ase with about 20 million gen@@ es , and I like to think of these as the design comp@@ on@@ ents of the future .
The elec@@ tr@@ on@@ ic@@ s in@@ du@@ str@@ y only had a do@@ zen or so comp@@ on@@ ents , and look at the di@@ vers@@ ity that came out of that .
We &apos;re li@@ mit@@ ed here pri@@ mar@@ ily by a bi@@ ologi@@ cal re@@ ality and our ima@@ g@@ in@@ ation .
We now have te@@ chni@@ qu@@ es , because of these rap@@ id me@@ th@@ o@@ ds of sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ is , to do what we &apos;re call@@ ing com@@ bin@@ at@@ ori@@ al gen@@ om@@ ic@@ s .
We have the abili@@ ty now to bu@@ ild a lar@@ ge ro@@ bo@@ t that can make a million ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ om@@ es a day .
When you think of pro@@ c@@ ess@@ ing these 20 million different gen@@ es or trying to op@@ ti@@ mi@@ ze pro@@ c@@ ess@@ es to produ@@ ce o@@ c@@ t@@ an@@ e or to produ@@ ce ph@@ ar@@ ma@@ c@@ eu@@ tic@@ als , new v@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ es , we can just with a small te@@ am , do more m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ular bi@@ olog@@ y than the last 20 years of all sci@@ ence .
And it &apos;s just stand@@ ard sel@@ ec@@ tion : we can sel@@ ect for vi@@ abili@@ ty , ch@@ em@@ ic@@ al or fu@@ el produc@@ tion , v@@ ac@@ c@@ ine produc@@ tion , et@@ c .
This is a s@@ cre@@ en s@@ n@@ ap@@ sho@@ t of some tr@@ ue design so@@ ft@@ w@@ are that we &apos;re working on to actually be able to s@@ it down and design spec@@ ies in the compu@@ ter .
You know , we don &apos;t know nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly what it &apos;ll look like : we know ex@@ ac@@ tly what their gen@@ e@@ tic co@@ de loo@@ ks like .
We &apos;re fo@@ c@@ using on now f@@ our@@ th@@ -@@ gener@@ ation fu@@ els .
You &apos;ve se@@ en rec@@ ent@@ ly , cor@@ n to e@@ th@@ an@@ ol is just a b@@ ad exper@@ im@@ ent .
We have secon@@ d@@ - and th@@ ir@@ d@@ -@@ gener@@ ation fu@@ els that will be coming out rel@@ ati@@ v@@ ely so@@ on that are su@@ g@@ ar , to much high@@ er@@ -@@ val@@ ue fu@@ els like o@@ c@@ t@@ an@@ e or different t@@ yp@@ es of b@@ ut@@ an@@ ol .
But the only way we think that bi@@ olog@@ y can have a ma@@ j@@ or imp@@ act with@@ out f@@ ur@@ ther incre@@ as@@ ing the c@@ ost of food and li@@ mit@@ ing its av@@ a@@ il@@ abili@@ ty is if we start with C@@ O@@ 2 as its fe@@ e@@ d@@ sto@@ ck , and so we &apos;re working with desig@@ ning c@@ ell@@ s to go down this ro@@ ad .
And we think we &apos;ll have the first f@@ our@@ th@@ -@@ gener@@ ation fu@@ els in about 1@@ 8 mon@@ ths .
S@@ un@@ light and C@@ O@@ 2 is one me@@ th@@ od ...
but in our dis@@ co@@ very around the world , we have all kin@@ ds of other me@@ th@@ o@@ ds .
This is an organ@@ is@@ m we des@@ cri@@ b@@ ed in 19@@ 9@@ 6 .
It li@@ ves in the de@@ ep o@@ ce@@ an , about a mi@@ le and a hal@@ f de@@ ep , al@@ most at bo@@ il@@ ing@@ -@@ water tem@@ per@@ at@@ ur@@ es .
It ta@@ kes C@@ O@@ 2 to me@@ th@@ an@@ e using m@@ ol@@ ec@@ ular hy@@ dro@@ gen as its energy s@@ our@@ ce .
We &apos;re looking to see if we can take cap@@ tu@@ red C@@ O@@ 2 , which can eas@@ ily be pi@@ p@@ ed to sit@@ es , con@@ ver@@ t that C@@ O@@ 2 back into fu@@ el to dri@@ ve this pro@@ cess .
So , in a sh@@ ort per@@ i@@ od of time , we think that we might be able to incre@@ ase what the bas@@ ic question is of &quot; What is life ? &quot;
We tru@@ ly , you know , have mo@@ des@@ t go@@ als of re@@ plac@@ ing the whole p@@ et@@ ro@@ l@@ -@@ ch@@ em@@ ic@@ al in@@ du@@ str@@ y -- Y@@ e@@ ah . If you can &apos;t do that at TED , where can you ? -- be@@ come a ma@@ j@@ or s@@ our@@ ce of energy ...
But also , we &apos;re now working on using these same to@@ ol@@ s to come up with in@@ st@@ ant s@@ ets of v@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ es .
You &apos;ve se@@ en this year with fl@@ u ; we &apos;re always a year beh@@ ind and a d@@ ollar sh@@ ort when it comes to the right v@@ ac@@ c@@ ine .
I think that can be chan@@ g@@ ed by building com@@ bin@@ at@@ ori@@ al v@@ ac@@ c@@ in@@ es in ad@@ v@@ ance .
Here &apos;s what the future may beg@@ in to look like with chan@@ ging , now , the evol@@ u@@ tion@@ ary tre@@ e , spe@@ e@@ ding up evol@@ ution with sy@@ n@@ the@@ tic b@@ ac@@ teri@@ a , Ar@@ ch@@ a@@ e@@ a and , ev@@ ent@@ u@@ ally , eu@@ k@@ ar@@ y@@ ot@@ es .
We &apos;re a ways away from im@@ pro@@ ving people : our go@@ al is just to make s@@ ure that we have a chan@@ ce to sur@@ vi@@ ve long enough to maybe do that . Thank you very much .
What I &apos;m going to show you first , as qui@@ ck@@ ly as I can , is some fo@@ un@@ da@@ tional work , some new technology that we br@@ ou@@ ght to M@@ ic@@ ros@@ o@@ ft as part of an ac@@ qu@@ isi@@ tion al@@ most ex@@ ac@@ tly a year ago .
This is Se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on , and it &apos;s an en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment in which you can ei@@ ther lo@@ c@@ ally or re@@ m@@ ot@@ ely inter@@ act with v@@ ast am@@ o@@ un@@ ts of vis@@ u@@ al data .
We &apos;re looking at many , many gi@@ g@@ ab@@ y@@ tes of dig@@ ital ph@@ ot@@ os here and kind of se@@ am@@ l@@ ess@@ ly and con@@ tin@@ u@@ ous@@ ly z@@ o@@ om@@ ing in , p@@ an@@ ning through it , re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ging it in any way we want .
And it doesn &apos;t mat@@ ter how much in@@ formation we &apos;re looking at , how big these col@@ lec@@ tions are or how big the ima@@ ges are .
M@@ ost of them are ord@@ in@@ ary dig@@ ital c@@ am@@ er@@ a ph@@ ot@@ os , but this one , for example , is a s@@ can from the Li@@ br@@ ary of C@@ on@@ g@@ res@@ s , and it &apos;s in the 3@@ 00 me@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el ran@@ ge .
It doesn &apos;t make any differ@@ ence because the only thing that ou@@ ght to li@@ mit the per@@ for@@ man@@ ce of a system like this one is the number of pi@@ x@@ els on your s@@ cre@@ en at any gi@@ ven m@@ oment .
It &apos;s also very f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble ar@@ chit@@ ec@@ ture .
This is an enti@@ re book , so this is an example of n@@ on@@ -@@ ima@@ ge data .
This is &quot; B@@ lea@@ k H@@ ou@@ se &quot; by Di@@ ck@@ ens . E@@ very col@@ um@@ n is a ch@@ ap@@ ter .
T@@ o pro@@ ve to you that it &apos;s really te@@ xt , and not an ima@@ ge , we can do something like so , to really show that this is a real re@@ pres@@ ent@@ ation of the te@@ xt ; it &apos;s not a pic@@ ture .
Ma@@ ybe this is an arti@@ f@@ ic@@ i@@ al way to re@@ ad an e-@@ book .
I w@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t re@@ comm@@ end it .
This is a more re@@ alis@@ tic c@@ ase , an is@@ su@@ e of The G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an .
E@@ very lar@@ ge ima@@ ge is the beg@@ inn@@ ing of a s@@ ec@@ tion .
And this really gi@@ ves you the j@@ o@@ y and the good experi@@ ence of read@@ ing the real p@@ ap@@ er ver@@ sion of a ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine or a ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er , which is an in@@ her@@ ent@@ ly m@@ ul@@ ti@@ -@@ sc@@ ale kind of medi@@ um .
We &apos;ve done something with the cor@@ ner of this partic@@ ular is@@ su@@ e of The G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an .
We &apos;ve made up a fa@@ ke ad that &apos;s very hi@@ gh res@@ ol@@ ution -- much high@@ er than in an ord@@ in@@ ary ad -- and we &apos;ve em@@ be@@ d@@ ded ex@@ tr@@ a con@@ t@@ ent .
If you want to see the fe@@ at@@ ur@@ es of this c@@ ar , you can see it here .
O@@ r other mo@@ d@@ els , or even te@@ chni@@ cal spec@@ i@@ f@@ ic@@ ations .
And this really ge@@ ts at some of these ideas about really doing away with those li@@ mit@@ s on s@@ cre@@ en real es@@ ta@@ te .
We hop@@ e that this means no more p@@ op@@ -@@ u@@ ps and other ru@@ b@@ bis@@ h like that -- sh@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t be nec@@ ess@@ ary .
O@@ f course , m@@ app@@ ing is one of those ob@@ vi@@ ous app@@ lic@@ ations for a technology like this .
And this one I really w@@ on &apos;t sp@@ end any time on , ex@@ ce@@ pt to say that we have things to con@@ tri@@ bu@@ te to this fi@@ eld as well .
But those are all the ro@@ a@@ ds in the U@@ .@@ S .
su@@ per@@ im@@ pos@@ ed on top of a N@@ A@@ SA ge@@ os@@ pa@@ ti@@ al ima@@ ge .
So let &apos;s p@@ ul@@ l up , now , something el@@ se .
This is actually live on the We@@ b now ; you can go ch@@ ec@@ k it out .
This is a pro@@ ject called Ph@@ ot@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ th , which mar@@ ri@@ es two different te@@ chn@@ ologi@@ es .
One of them is Se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on and the other is some very beau@@ ti@@ ful compu@@ ter@@ -@@ v@@ isi@@ on res@@ ear@@ ch done by N@@ o@@ ah S@@ n@@ av@@ ely , a gra@@ du@@ ate stu@@ d@@ ent at the Univers@@ ity of W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ ton , co@@ -@@ ad@@ vis@@ ed by S@@ te@@ ve S@@ ei@@ t@@ z at U@@ .@@ W .
and R@@ ic@@ k S@@ ze@@ li@@ sk@@ i at M@@ ic@@ ros@@ o@@ ft R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch . A very ni@@ ce c@@ oll@@ ab@@ or@@ ation .
And so this is live on the We@@ b . It &apos;s po@@ wer@@ ed by Se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on .
You can see that when we do these sor@@ ts of vie@@ ws , where we can di@@ ve through ima@@ ges and have this kind of m@@ ul@@ ti@@ -@@ res@@ ol@@ ution experi@@ ence .
But the sp@@ ati@@ al ar@@ ran@@ ge@@ ment of the ima@@ ges here is actually me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful .
The compu@@ ter v@@ isi@@ on al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ ms have re@@ g@@ is@@ ter@@ ed these ima@@ ges together so that they cor@@ res@@ pon@@ d to the real space in which these sh@@ ots -- all ta@@ ken ne@@ ar Gr@@ ass@@ i L@@ ak@@ es in the C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an Ro@@ ck@@ ies -- all these sh@@ ots were ta@@ ken . So you see el@@ em@@ ents here of st@@ abili@@ zed s@@ li@@ de@@ -@@ show or p@@ an@@ or@@ am@@ ic ima@@ ging , and these things have all been rel@@ ated sp@@ ati@@ ally .
I &apos;m not s@@ ure if I have time to show you any other en@@ vi@@ ron@@ m@@ ents .
S@@ ome are much more sp@@ ati@@ al .
I would like to j@@ um@@ p stra@@ i@@ ght to one of N@@ o@@ ah &apos;s or@@ ig@@ in@@ al dat@@ a@@ -@@ s@@ ets -- this is from an ear@@ ly pr@@ ot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e that we first got working this su@@ m@@ mer -- to show you what I think is really the p@@ un@@ ch line beh@@ ind the Ph@@ ot@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ th technology , It &apos;s not nec@@ ess@@ ari@@ ly so ap@@ par@@ ent from looking at the en@@ vi@@ ron@@ m@@ ents we &apos;ve put up on the we@@ b@@ si@@ te .
We had to wor@@ ry about the la@@ w@@ y@@ ers and so on .
This is a re@@ con@@ struc@@ tion of N@@ ot@@ re D@@ ame C@@ a@@ the@@ dra@@ l that was done enti@@ r@@ ely comp@@ ut@@ ation@@ ally from ima@@ ges sc@@ rap@@ ed from F@@ li@@ ck@@ r .
You just t@@ yp@@ e N@@ ot@@ re D@@ ame into F@@ li@@ ck@@ r , and you get some pic@@ tur@@ es of gu@@ ys in T@@ -@@ shi@@ r@@ ts , and of the c@@ am@@ p@@ us and so on .
And each of these or@@ an@@ ge con@@ es re@@ pres@@ ents an ima@@ ge that was dis@@ co@@ ver@@ ed to bel@@ ong to this mo@@ del .
And so these are all F@@ li@@ ck@@ r ima@@ ges , and they &apos;ve all been rel@@ ated sp@@ ati@@ ally in this way .
We can just n@@ avi@@ g@@ ate in this very sim@@ ple way .
You know , I never thought that I &apos;d end up working at M@@ ic@@ ros@@ o@@ ft .
It &apos;s very gra@@ ti@@ f@@ ying to have this kind of rec@@ ep@@ tion here .
I gu@@ ess you can see this is l@@ ots of different t@@ yp@@ es of c@@ am@@ er@@ as : it &apos;s everything from c@@ ell@@ -@@ ph@@ one c@@ am@@ er@@ as to pro@@ f@@ es@@ si@@ on@@ al S@@ L@@ R@@ s , quite a lar@@ ge number of them , sti@@ t@@ ch@@ ed together in this en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment .
If I can find some of the sort of wei@@ r@@ d ones -- So many of them are o@@ c@@ c@@ lu@@ ded by fac@@ es , and so on .
S@@ om@@ e@@ where in here there is actually a s@@ eri@@ es of ph@@ ot@@ ograp@@ h@@ s -- here we go .
This is actually a pos@@ ter of N@@ ot@@ re D@@ ame that re@@ g@@ is@@ ter@@ ed cor@@ rec@@ tly .
We can di@@ ve in from the pos@@ ter to a physi@@ cal vie@@ w of this en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment .
What the point here really is is that we can do things with the soci@@ al en@@ vi@@ ron@@ ment .
This is now ta@@ king data from every@@ body -- from the enti@@ re col@@ lec@@ tive mem@@ ory , vis@@ u@@ ally , of what the Earth loo@@ ks like -- and lin@@ k all of that together .
Th@@ ose ph@@ ot@@ os be@@ come lin@@ ked , and they make something em@@ erg@@ ent that &apos;s gre@@ ater than the s@@ um of the par@@ ts .
You have a mo@@ del that em@@ erg@@ es of the enti@@ re Earth .
Th@@ in@@ k of this as the long ta@@ il to S@@ te@@ ph@@ en L@@ a@@ w@@ ler &apos;s V@@ ir@@ tu@@ al Earth work .
And this is something that gro@@ ws in comp@@ le@@ x@@ ity as people use it , and wh@@ ose ben@@ ef@@ its be@@ come gre@@ ater to the us@@ ers as they use it .
Th@@ ei@@ r own ph@@ ot@@ os are getting ta@@ g@@ g@@ ed with m@@ et@@ a@@ -@@ data that some@@ body el@@ se en@@ ter@@ ed .
If some@@ body bo@@ ther@@ ed to ta@@ g all of these sa@@ in@@ ts and say who they all are , then my ph@@ o@@ to of N@@ ot@@ re D@@ ame C@@ a@@ the@@ dra@@ l su@@ d@@ den@@ ly ge@@ ts en@@ ri@@ ch@@ ed with all of that data , and I can use it as an ent@@ ry point to di@@ ve into that space , into that m@@ et@@ a@@ -@@ verse , using every@@ body el@@ se &apos;s ph@@ ot@@ os , and do a kind of a c@@ ros@@ s@@ -@@ mo@@ d@@ al and c@@ ros@@ s@@ -@@ us@@ er soci@@ al experi@@ ence that way .
And of course , a b@@ y@@ -@@ produc@@ t of all of that is im@@ men@@ sel@@ y r@@ ich vir@@ tu@@ al mo@@ d@@ els of every interesting part of the Earth , col@@ lec@@ ted not just from o@@ ver@@ he@@ ad f@@ li@@ gh@@ ts and from s@@ at@@ el@@ li@@ te ima@@ ges and so on , but from the col@@ lec@@ tive mem@@ ory .
Thank you so much .
Chr@@ is An@@ der@@ son : D@@ o I understand this right ? What your so@@ ft@@ w@@ are is going to al@@ low , is that at some point , really with@@ in the next few years , all the pic@@ tur@@ es that are sh@@ ar@@ ed by any@@ one ac@@ ross the world are going to lin@@ k together ?
B@@ A@@ A : Y@@ es . What this is really doing is dis@@ co@@ ver@@ ing , cre@@ ating hy@@ per@@ lin@@ ks , if you will , between ima@@ ges .
It &apos;s doing that bas@@ ed on the con@@ t@@ ent in@@ side the ima@@ ges .
And that ge@@ ts really ex@@ c@@ it@@ ing when you think about the ri@@ chn@@ ess of the s@@ em@@ an@@ tic in@@ formation a lot of ima@@ ges have .
Li@@ ke when you do a we@@ b se@@ ar@@ ch for ima@@ ges , you t@@ yp@@ e in p@@ hr@@ as@@ es , and the te@@ xt on the we@@ b pa@@ ge is car@@ r@@ ying a lot of in@@ formation about what that pic@@ ture is of .
What if that pic@@ ture lin@@ ks to all of your pic@@ tur@@ es ?
The am@@ o@@ un@@ t of s@@ em@@ an@@ tic inter@@ connec@@ tion and ri@@ chn@@ ess that comes out of that is really hu@@ ge .
It &apos;s a cl@@ assi@@ c net@@ work eff@@ ect .
C@@ A : T@@ ru@@ ly incre@@ di@@ ble . C@@ on@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ations .
You know , one of the in@@ ten@@ se ple@@ as@@ ur@@ es of tra@@ v@@ el and one of the de@@ li@@ gh@@ ts of e@@ th@@ no@@ gr@@ ap@@ hi@@ c res@@ ear@@ ch is the op@@ port@@ unity to live am@@ on@@ g@@ st those who have not for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten the old ways , who still feel their p@@ ast in the w@@ ind , t@@ ou@@ ch it in st@@ ones poli@@ sh@@ ed by ra@@ in , ta@@ ste it in the b@@ it@@ ter lea@@ ves of plan@@ ts .
J@@ ust to know that J@@ ag@@ u@@ ar sh@@ am@@ ans still j@@ our@@ ne@@ y be@@ y@@ on@@ d the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay , or the my@@ ths of the In@@ u@@ it el@@ der@@ s still res@@ on@@ ate with me@@ an@@ ing , or that in the H@@ im@@ al@@ a@@ y@@ a , the Bu@@ dd@@ h@@ is@@ ts still p@@ ur@@ su@@ e the bre@@ at@@ h of the D@@ har@@ ma , is to really re@@ mem@@ ber the cent@@ ra@@ l re@@ vel@@ ation of an@@ th@@ rop@@ olog@@ y , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not ex@@ ist in some ab@@ sol@@ ute sense , but is just one mo@@ del of re@@ ality ,
the con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of one partic@@ ular set of ad@@ ap@@ tive cho@@ ic@@ es that our lin@@ e@@ age made , al@@ beit su@@ c@@ c@@ ess@@ f@@ ul@@ ly , many gener@@ ations ago .
And of course , we all sh@@ are the same ad@@ ap@@ tive im@@ per@@ ati@@ ves .
We &apos;re all bor@@ n . We all br@@ ing our children into the world .
We go through ini@@ ti@@ ation rit@@ es .
We have to de@@ al with the in@@ ex@@ or@@ able se@@ par@@ ation of de@@ at@@ h , so it sh@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t sur@@ pr@@ is@@ e us that we all s@@ ing , we all dan@@ ce , we all have art .
But what &apos;s interesting is the uni@@ qu@@ e c@@ a@@ den@@ ce of the s@@ ong , the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m of the dan@@ ce in every cul@@ ture .
And wh@@ e@@ ther it is the P@@ en@@ an in the for@@ es@@ ts of B@@ or@@ ne@@ o , or the V@@ oo@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes in Ha@@ it@@ i , or the war@@ ri@@ ors in the K@@ a@@ is@@ ut des@@ ert of N@@ or@@ th@@ ern K@@ en@@ y@@ a , the C@@ ur@@ ander@@ o in the mo@@ un@@ ta@@ ins of the An@@ des , or a car@@ av@@ an@@ ser@@ a@@ i in the mi@@ dd@@ le of the S@@ ah@@ ar@@ a -- this is in@@ ci@@ d@@ ent@@ ally the f@@ el@@ low that I tra@@ vel@@ ed into the des@@ ert with a mon@@ th ago -- or in@@ de@@ ed a y@@ ak her@@ der in the s@@ lo@@ p@@ es of Q@@ om@@ ol@@ an@@ g@@ ma ,
E@@ ver@@ est , the go@@ d@@ des@@ s mo@@ ther of the world .
All of these pe@@ op@@ les te@@ ach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of ori@@ ent@@ ing y@@ our@@ self in the Earth .
And this is an idea , if you think about it , can only fil@@ l you with hop@@ e .
Now , together the my@@ ri@@ ad cul@@ tur@@ es of the world make up a we@@ b of spi@@ ri@@ tu@@ al life and cul@@ tur@@ al life that en@@ vel@@ op@@ s the planet , and is as important to the w@@ ell@@ -@@ being of the planet as in@@ de@@ ed is the bi@@ ologi@@ cal we@@ b of life that you know as a bi@@ os@@ p@@ here .
And you might think of this cul@@ tur@@ al we@@ b of life as being an e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ p@@ here , and you might de@@ f@@ ine the e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ p@@ here as being the s@@ um t@@ ot@@ al of all thou@@ gh@@ ts and dre@@ am@@ s , my@@ ths , ideas , in@@ spi@@ ra@@ tions , in@@ tu@@ i@@ tions br@@ ou@@ ght into being by the human ima@@ g@@ in@@ ation sin@@ ce the da@@ wn of con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness .
The e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ p@@ here is hum@@ an@@ ity &apos;s great le@@ g@@ ac@@ y .
It &apos;s the sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of all that we are and all that we can be as an ast@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing@@ ly in@@ qu@@ isi@@ tive spec@@ ies .
And just as the bi@@ os@@ p@@ here has been se@@ ver@@ ely er@@ o@@ ded , so too is the e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ p@@ here -- and , if anything , at a f@@ ar gre@@ ater ra@@ te .
No bi@@ olog@@ is@@ ts , for example , would d@@ are su@@ g@@ ges@@ t that 50 percent of all spec@@ ies or more have been or are on the br@@ in@@ k of ex@@ tin@@ c@@ tion because it sim@@ p@@ ly is not tr@@ ue , and y@@ et that -- the most ap@@ o@@ c@@ al@@ yp@@ tic sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o in the re@@ al@@ m of bi@@ ologi@@ cal di@@ vers@@ ity -- sc@@ ar@@ c@@ ely ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ es what we know to be the most op@@ tim@@ is@@ tic sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o in the re@@ al@@ m of cul@@ tur@@ al di@@ vers@@ ity .
And the great in@@ dic@@ at@@ or of that , of course , is lan@@ gu@@ age los@@ s .
When each of you in this ro@@ om were bor@@ n , there were 6@@ ,000 lan@@ gu@@ ag@@ es sp@@ o@@ ken on the planet .
Now , a lan@@ gu@@ age is not just a body of v@@ o@@ c@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary or a set of gra@@ m@@ ma@@ tical r@@ ul@@ es .
A lan@@ gu@@ age is a fl@@ as@@ h of the human sp@@ ir@@ it .
It &apos;s a v@@ eh@@ ic@@ le through which the s@@ ou@@ l of each partic@@ ular cul@@ ture comes into the mat@@ eri@@ al world .
E@@ very lan@@ gu@@ age is an ol@@ d@@ -@@ gro@@ w@@ th for@@ est of the m@@ ind , a wat@@ er@@ sh@@ ed , a thought , an ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem of spi@@ ri@@ tu@@ al possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ties .
And of those 6@@ ,000 lan@@ gu@@ ag@@ es , as we s@@ it here today in Mon@@ ter@@ ey , f@@ ul@@ ly hal@@ f are no l@@ on@@ ger being wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed into the ear@@ s of children .
They &apos;re no l@@ on@@ ger being t@@ au@@ ght to bab@@ ies , which means , eff@@ ec@@ tiv@@ ely , un@@ less something chan@@ ges , they &apos;re al@@ ready de@@ ad .
What could be more l@@ on@@ ely than to be en@@ vel@@ op@@ ed in s@@ il@@ ence , to be the last of your people to spe@@ ak your lan@@ gu@@ age , to have no way to p@@ ass on the wis@@ do@@ m of the an@@ c@@ est@@ ors or an@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate the pro@@ mis@@ e of the children ?
And y@@ et , that dre@@ ad@@ ful f@@ ate is in@@ de@@ ed the p@@ light of some@@ body some@@ where on Earth r@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly every two we@@ e@@ ks , because every two we@@ e@@ ks , some el@@ der dies and car@@ ri@@ es with him into the gra@@ ve the last sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ les of an an@@ ci@@ ent t@@ on@@ gu@@ e .
And I know there &apos;s some of you who say , &quot; Well , w@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t it be better , w@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just sp@@ o@@ ke one lan@@ gu@@ age ? &quot; And I say , &quot; G@@ re@@ at , let &apos;s make that lan@@ gu@@ age Yor@@ ub@@ a . L@@ et &apos;s make it C@@ ant@@ on@@ ese .
L@@ et &apos;s make it K@@ og@@ i . &quot;
And you &apos;ll su@@ d@@ den@@ ly dis@@ co@@ ver what it would be like to be un@@ able to spe@@ ak your own lan@@ gu@@ age .
And so , what I &apos;d like to do with you today is sort of take you on a j@@ our@@ ne@@ y through the e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ p@@ here , a b@@ rie@@ f j@@ our@@ ne@@ y through the e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ p@@ here , to try to beg@@ in to give you a sense of what in fact is being l@@ ost .
Now , there are many of us who sort of for@@ get that when I say &quot; different ways of being , &quot; I really do mean different ways of being .
Ta@@ ke , for example , this ch@@ ild of a B@@ ar@@ as@@ an@@ a in the N@@ or@@ th@@ w@@ est A@@ ma@@ z@@ on , the people of the an@@ ac@@ on@@ da who believe that my@@ th@@ ologi@@ c@@ ally they came up the m@@ il@@ k ri@@ ver from the e@@ ast in the bel@@ ly of s@@ ac@@ red s@@ n@@ ak@@ es .
Now , this is a people who c@@ og@@ ni@@ tiv@@ ely do not dis@@ t@@ ing@@ u@@ ish the col@@ or b@@ lu@@ e from the col@@ or gre@@ en because the can@@ op@@ y of the he@@ av@@ ens is e@@ qu@@ ated to the can@@ op@@ y of the for@@ est up@@ on which the people de@@ p@@ end .
They have a c@@ u@@ ri@@ ous lan@@ gu@@ age and mar@@ ri@@ age ru@@ le which is called &quot; l@@ ing@@ u@@ is@@ tic ex@@ og@@ am@@ y : &quot; you m@@ ust mar@@ ry some@@ one who spe@@ a@@ ks a different lan@@ gu@@ age .
And this is all ro@@ ot@@ ed in the my@@ th@@ ologi@@ cal p@@ ast , y@@ et the c@@ u@@ ri@@ ous thing is in these long h@@ ous@@ es , where there are si@@ x or se@@ ven lan@@ gu@@ ag@@ es sp@@ o@@ ken because of inter@@ mar@@ ri@@ age , you never he@@ ar any@@ one p@@ ra@@ c@@ tic@@ ing a lan@@ gu@@ age .
They sim@@ p@@ ly li@@ sten and then beg@@ in to spe@@ ak .
O@@ r , one of the most fas@@ c@@ in@@ ating tri@@ b@@ es I ever li@@ ved with , the W@@ a@@ or@@ an@@ i of nor@@ the@@ ast@@ ern E@@ c@@ u@@ ad@@ or , an ast@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing people first con@@ t@@ ac@@ ted pe@@ ac@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly in 19@@ 5@@ 8 .
In 19@@ 5@@ 7 , five mis@@ si@@ on@@ ar@@ ies att@@ em@@ p@@ ted con@@ t@@ act and made a cri@@ tical mis@@ take .
They dro@@ pp@@ ed from the a@@ ir 8 x 10 gl@@ os@@ s@@ y ph@@ ot@@ ograp@@ h@@ s of the@@ m@@ selves in what we would say to be fri@@ end@@ ly ges@@ tur@@ es , for@@ getting that these people of the ra@@ in@@ for@@ est had never se@@ en anything t@@ wo@@ -@@ di@@ men@@ si@@ on@@ al in their li@@ ves .
They pi@@ ck@@ ed up these ph@@ ot@@ ograp@@ h@@ s from the for@@ est flo@@ or , tri@@ ed to look beh@@ ind the face to find the form or the fig@@ ure , found no@@ thing , and con@@ c@@ lu@@ ded that these were call@@ ing car@@ ds from the de@@ vi@@ l , so they sp@@ ear@@ ed the five mis@@ si@@ on@@ ar@@ ies to de@@ at@@ h .
But the W@@ a@@ or@@ an@@ i didn &apos;t just spe@@ ar out@@ si@@ der@@ s .
They sp@@ ear@@ ed each other .
5@@ 4 percent of their mor@@ tal@@ ity was du@@ e to them sp@@ ear@@ ing each other .
We tra@@ c@@ ed gen@@ e@@ al@@ o@@ gi@@ es back ei@@ ght gener@@ ations , and we found two in@@ st@@ an@@ ces of nat@@ ur@@ al de@@ at@@ h and when we pres@@ su@@ red the people a little bit about it , they ad@@ mit@@ ted that one of the f@@ el@@ lo@@ ws had g@@ ot@@ ten so old that he di@@ ed getting old , so we sp@@ ear@@ ed him any@@ way . But at the same time they had a per@@ sp@@ ic@@ ac@@ i@@ ous kno@@ w@@ le@@ dge of the for@@ est that was ast@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing .
Th@@ ei@@ r h@@ unter@@ s could sm@@ ell ani@@ mal ur@@ ine at 4@@ 0 p@@ ac@@ es and tell you what spec@@ ies left it beh@@ ind .
In the ear@@ ly &apos; 8@@ 0@@ s , I had a really ast@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing assi@@ g@@ n@@ ment when I was as@@ ked by my pro@@ f@@ ess@@ or at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard if I was interes@@ ted in going down to Ha@@ it@@ i , in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ating the s@@ ec@@ re@@ t soci@@ e@@ ties which were the fo@@ un@@ da@@ tion of D@@ u@@ v@@ ali@@ er &apos;s str@@ eng@@ th and T@@ on@@ ton M@@ ac@@ ou@@ tes , and s@@ ec@@ ur@@ ing the po@@ is@@ on used to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es .
In or@@ der to make sense out of sen@@ sa@@ tion , of course , I had to understand something about this re@@ mark@@ able fa@@ it@@ h of V@@ o@@ d@@ ou@@ n . And V@@ oo@@ do@@ o is not a bl@@ ack ma@@ gi@@ c cul@@ t .
O@@ n the con@@ tr@@ ary , it &apos;s a comp@@ le@@ x m@@ et@@ ap@@ h@@ ysi@@ cal wor@@ l@@ d@@ vie@@ w .
It &apos;s interesting .
If I as@@ ked you to n@@ ame the great re@@ ligi@@ ons of the world , what would you say ?
Chr@@ is@@ ti@@ an@@ ity , I@@ s@@ l@@ am , Bu@@ dd@@ h@@ is@@ m , J@@ u@@ da@@ is@@ m , wh@@ at@@ ever .
There &apos;s always one con@@ tin@@ ent left out , the as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion being that sub@@ -@@ S@@ ah@@ ar@@ an Africa had no re@@ ligi@@ ous belie@@ f@@ s . Well , of course , they did and V@@ oo@@ do@@ o is sim@@ p@@ ly the dis@@ ti@@ ll@@ ation of these very pro@@ found re@@ ligi@@ ous ideas that came over dur@@ ing the tra@@ gi@@ c Di@@ as@@ por@@ a of the s@@ la@@ very er@@ a .
But , what ma@@ kes V@@ oo@@ do@@ o so interesting is that it &apos;s this li@@ ving rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p between the li@@ ving and the de@@ ad .
So , the li@@ ving give b@@ ir@@ th to the spi@@ ri@@ ts .
The spi@@ ri@@ ts can be inv@@ o@@ ked from ben@@ e@@ at@@ h the G@@ re@@ at W@@ ater , res@@ pon@@ ding to the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m of the dan@@ ce to m@@ om@@ ent@@ ari@@ ly dis@@ place the s@@ ou@@ l of the li@@ ving , so that for that b@@ rie@@ f sh@@ in@@ ing m@@ oment , the ac@@ ol@@ y@@ te be@@ comes the go@@ d .
That &apos;s why the V@@ oo@@ do@@ o@@ is@@ ts like to say that &quot; You whi@@ te people go to ch@@ ur@@ ch and spe@@ ak about G@@ od .
We dan@@ ce in the tem@@ ple and be@@ come G@@ od . &quot;
And because you are pos@@ s@@ ess@@ ed , you are ta@@ ken by the sp@@ ir@@ it -- how can you be har@@ m@@ ed ?
So you see these ast@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tions : V@@ oo@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes in a st@@ ate of tr@@ ance hand@@ l@@ ing b@@ ur@@ ning em@@ ber@@ s with imp@@ unity , a ra@@ ther ast@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing de@@ mon@@ stra@@ tion of the abili@@ ty of the m@@ ind to aff@@ ect the body that be@@ ars it when c@@ at@@ al@@ y@@ zed in the st@@ ate of ex@@ tre@@ me ex@@ c@@ it@@ ation .
Now , of all the pe@@ op@@ les that I &apos;ve ever been with , the most ex@@ tra@@ ord@@ in@@ ary are the K@@ og@@ i of the Si@@ er@@ r@@ a N@@ ev@@ ad@@ a de S@@ ant@@ a Mar@@ t@@ a in nor@@ th@@ ern C@@ ol@@ om@@ bi@@ a .
Des@@ c@@ en@@ dan@@ ts of the an@@ ci@@ ent Ta@@ ir@@ on@@ a ci@@ vi@@ li@@ z@@ ation which on@@ ce car@@ p@@ et@@ ed the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pl@@ ain of C@@ ol@@ om@@ bi@@ a , in the wa@@ ke of the con@@ qu@@ est , these people re@@ tre@@ ated into an is@@ ol@@ ated vol@@ can@@ ic m@@ assi@@ f that so@@ ars ab@@ o@@ ve the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pl@@ ain .
In a b@@ loo@@ d@@ sta@@ in@@ ed con@@ tin@@ ent , these people al@@ one were never con@@ qu@@ er@@ ed by the Sp@@ an@@ ish .
T@@ o this day , they re@@ ma@@ in r@@ ul@@ ed by a ri@@ tu@@ al pri@@ es@@ th@@ o@@ od but the tra@@ in@@ ing for the pri@@ es@@ th@@ o@@ od is ra@@ ther ex@@ tra@@ ord@@ in@@ ary .
The y@@ o@@ ung ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes are ta@@ ken away from their fam@@ ili@@ es at the age of three and four , se@@ ques@@ ter@@ ed in a s@@ ha@@ do@@ w@@ y world of dar@@ k@@ ness in st@@ one hu@@ ts at the b@@ ase of gl@@ ac@@ i@@ ers for 1@@ 8 years : two n@@ in@@ e-@@ year per@@ i@@ o@@ ds de@@ li@@ ber@@ at@@ ely ch@@ os@@ en to m@@ im@@ ic the n@@ ine mon@@ ths of ges@@ ta@@ tion they sp@@ end in their nat@@ ur@@ al mo@@ ther &apos;s wom@@ b ; now they are m@@ et@@ ap@@ h@@ or@@ ically in the wom@@ b of the great mo@@ ther .
And for this enti@@ re time , they are in@@ cul@@ tur@@ ated into the val@@ u@@ es of their soci@@ et@@ y , val@@ u@@ es that ma@@ in@@ tain the pro@@ posi@@ tion that their p@@ ra@@ y@@ ers and their p@@ ra@@ y@@ ers al@@ one ma@@ in@@ tain the c@@ os@@ mi@@ c -- or we might say the ec@@ ologi@@ cal -- b@@ al@@ ance .
And at the end of this a@@ ma@@ zing ini@@ ti@@ ation , one day they &apos;re su@@ d@@ den@@ ly ta@@ ken out and for the first time in their li@@ ves , at the age of 1@@ 8 , they see a s@@ un@@ ris@@ e . And in that c@@ r@@ y@@ st@@ al m@@ oment of a@@ war@@ en@@ ess of first light as the S@@ un beg@@ ins to b@@ a@@ the the s@@ lo@@ p@@ es of the st@@ un@@ n@@ ing@@ ly beau@@ ti@@ ful l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e , su@@ d@@ den@@ ly everything they have lear@@ ned in the ab@@ stra@@ c@@ t is aff@@ ir@@ m@@ ed in st@@ un@@ ning gl@@ ory . And the pri@@ est st@@ ep@@ s back
and says , &quot; You see ? It &apos;s really as I &apos;ve t@@ old you .
It is that beau@@ ti@@ ful . It is y@@ our@@ s to pr@@ ot@@ ect . &quot;
They call the@@ m@@ selves the &quot; el@@ der bro@@ th@@ ers &quot; and they say we , who are the y@@ o@@ ung@@ er bro@@ th@@ ers , are the ones res@@ pon@@ si@@ ble for des@@ tro@@ ying the world .
Now , this le@@ v@@ el of in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion be@@ comes very important .
Wh@@ en@@ ever we think of in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous people and l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e , we ei@@ ther inv@@ o@@ ke R@@ ous@@ se@@ au and the old can@@ ard of the &quot; no@@ ble sa@@ v@@ age , &quot; which is an idea ra@@ c@@ ist in its sim@@ p@@ lic@@ ity , or al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ v@@ ely , we inv@@ o@@ ke Th@@ or@@ e@@ au and say these people are cl@@ os@@ er to the Earth than we are .
Well , in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous people are n@@ ei@@ ther s@@ enti@@ ment@@ al n@@ or we@@ ak@@ en@@ ed by n@@ os@@ tal@@ gi@@ a .
There &apos;s not a lot of ro@@ om for ei@@ ther in the m@@ al@@ ari@@ al s@@ w@@ am@@ ps of the A@@ sm@@ at or in the ch@@ ill@@ ing win@@ ds of Ti@@ be@@ t , but they have , ne@@ ver@@ th@@ el@@ ess , through time and ri@@ tu@@ al , for@@ g@@ ed a tra@@ di@@ tional my@@ sti@@ qu@@ e of the Earth that is bas@@ ed not on the idea of being sel@@ f@@ -@@ con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ly cl@@ ose to it , but on a f@@ ar sub@@ t@@ ler in@@ tu@@ i@@ tion : the idea that the Earth it@@ self can only ex@@ ist because it is bre@@ a@@ th@@ ed into being by human con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness .
Now , what does that mean ?
It means that a y@@ o@@ ung k@@ id from the An@@ des who &apos;s ra@@ is@@ ed to believe that that mo@@ un@@ tain is an A@@ p@@ u sp@@ ir@@ it that will di@@ rec@@ t his or her des@@ tin@@ y will be a pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly different human being and have a different rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p to that res@@ our@@ ce or that place than a y@@ o@@ ung k@@ id from Mon@@ t@@ an@@ a ra@@ is@@ ed to believe that a mo@@ un@@ tain is a pi@@ le of ro@@ ck ready to be min@@ ed .
W@@ he@@ ther it &apos;s the ab@@ o@@ de of a sp@@ ir@@ it or a pi@@ le of ore is ir@@ rel@@ ev@@ ant .
What &apos;s interesting is the m@@ et@@ ap@@ h@@ or that de@@ fin@@ es the rel@@ ation@@ shi@@ p between the in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al and the nat@@ ur@@ al world .
I was ra@@ is@@ ed in the for@@ es@@ ts of B@@ ri@@ ti@@ s@@ h C@@ ol@@ um@@ bi@@ a to believe those for@@ es@@ ts ex@@ is@@ ted to be c@@ ut .
That made me a different human being than my fri@@ ends am@@ on@@ g@@ st the K@@ wa@@ gi@@ ul@@ th who believe that those for@@ es@@ ts were the ab@@ o@@ de of H@@ u@@ x@@ wh@@ u@@ k@@ w and the C@@ ro@@ o@@ ked Be@@ ak of H@@ e@@ a@@ ven and the can@@ ni@@ b@@ al spi@@ ri@@ ts that d@@ w@@ ell@@ ed at the nor@@ th end of the world , spi@@ ri@@ ts they would have to eng@@ age dur@@ ing their H@@ am@@ at@@ s@@ a ini@@ ti@@ ation .
Now , if you beg@@ in to look at the idea that these cul@@ tur@@ es could create different re@@ ali@@ ties , you could beg@@ in to understand some of their ex@@ tra@@ ord@@ in@@ ary dis@@ co@@ ver@@ ies . Ta@@ ke this pl@@ ant here .
It &apos;s a ph@@ ot@@ ograp@@ h I took in the N@@ or@@ th@@ w@@ est A@@ ma@@ z@@ on just last A@@ pri@@ l .
This is a@@ y@@ ah@@ u@@ as@@ ca , which many of you have hear@@ d about , the most po@@ wer@@ ful p@@ sy@@ cho@@ ac@@ tive pre@@ par@@ ation of the sh@@ am@@ an &apos;s re@@ per@@ to@@ ir@@ e .
What ma@@ kes a@@ y@@ ah@@ u@@ as@@ ca fas@@ c@@ in@@ ating is not the sh@@ e@@ er ph@@ ar@@ ma@@ col@@ o@@ gi@@ cal p@@ ot@@ enti@@ al of this pre@@ par@@ ation , but the el@@ ab@@ or@@ ation of it . It &apos;s made really of two different s@@ our@@ ces : on the one h@@ and , this w@@ oo@@ dy li@@ an@@ a which has in it a s@@ eri@@ es of be@@ ta@@ -@@ car@@ b@@ ol@@ in@@ es , har@@ m@@ ine , har@@ m@@ al@@ ine , m@@ il@@ d@@ ly h@@ all@@ u@@ c@@ in@@ o@@ gen@@ ic -- to take the v@@ ine al@@ one is ra@@ ther to have sort of b@@ lu@@ e ha@@ z@@ y s@@ mo@@ ke dri@@ ft ac@@ ross your con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness -- but it &apos;s mi@@ x@@ ed with the lea@@ ves of a s@@ hr@@ u@@ b in the co@@ ff@@ e@@ e fam@@ ily
called P@@ sy@@ ch@@ ot@@ ri@@ a vi@@ ri@@ d@@ is .
This pl@@ ant had in it some very po@@ wer@@ ful tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ in@@ es , very cl@@ ose to brain ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in , di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ ine , 5@@ -@@ me@@ th@@ o@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ ine .
If you &apos;ve ever se@@ en the Y@@ an@@ om@@ am@@ i blo@@ wing that s@@ n@@ u@@ ff up their n@@ os@@ es , that sub@@ st@@ ance they make from a different set of spec@@ ies also con@@ ta@@ ins me@@ th@@ o@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ ine .
T@@ o have that po@@ w@@ der blo@@ wn up your n@@ ose is ra@@ ther like being sho@@ t out of a ri@@ f@@ le bar@@ re@@ l lin@@ ed with b@@ aro@@ qu@@ e pa@@ in@@ t@@ ings and l@@ and@@ ing on a se@@ a of elec@@ tri@@ city . It doesn &apos;t create the dis@@ t@@ or@@ tion of re@@ ality ; it cre@@ ates the dis@@ sol@@ ution of re@@ ality .
In fact , I used to ar@@ gu@@ e with my pro@@ f@@ ess@@ or , Ri@@ ch@@ ard E@@ v@@ an S@@ h@@ ul@@ tes -- who is a man who sp@@ ar@@ ked the p@@ sy@@ ch@@ e@@ de@@ li@@ c er@@ a with his dis@@ co@@ very of the ma@@ gi@@ c mus@@ h@@ ro@@ om@@ s in M@@ ex@@ ic@@ o in the 19@@ 3@@ 0@@ s -- I used to ar@@ gu@@ e that you cou@@ ldn &apos;t cl@@ assi@@ f@@ y these tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ in@@ es as h@@ all@@ u@@ c@@ in@@ o@@ gen@@ ic because by the time you &apos;re un@@ der the eff@@ ects there &apos;s no one h@@ ome any@@ more to experi@@ ence a h@@ all@@ u@@ c@@ in@@ ation . But the thing about tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ in@@ es is they can@@ not be ta@@ ken or@@ ally
because they &apos;re den@@ at@@ u@@ red by an en@@ z@@ y@@ me found nat@@ ur@@ ally in the human gut called mon@@ o@@ am@@ ine o@@ x@@ i@@ d@@ ase .
They can only be ta@@ ken or@@ ally if ta@@ ken in con@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ tion with some other ch@@ em@@ ic@@ al that den@@ at@@ ur@@ es the M@@ A@@ O .
Now , the fas@@ c@@ in@@ ating things are that the be@@ ta@@ -@@ car@@ b@@ ol@@ in@@ es found with@@ in that li@@ an@@ a are M@@ A@@ O in@@ hi@@ b@@ it@@ ors of the pre@@ c@@ is@@ e sort nec@@ ess@@ ary to p@@ ot@@ enti@@ ate the tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ ine . So you ask y@@ our@@ self a question .
How , in a fl@@ or@@ a of 8@@ 0@@ ,000 spec@@ ies of v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar plan@@ ts , do these people find these two mor@@ ph@@ ologi@@ c@@ ally un@@ rel@@ ated plan@@ ts that when com@@ bin@@ ed in this way , cre@@ ated a kind of bi@@ o@@ ch@@ em@@ ic@@ al ver@@ sion of the whole being gre@@ ater than the s@@ um of the par@@ ts ?
Well , we use that great eu@@ ph@@ em@@ is@@ m , &quot; tri@@ al and er@@ ro@@ r , &quot; which is ex@@ pos@@ ed to be me@@ an@@ ing@@ less .
But you ask the Indi@@ ans , and they say , &quot; The plan@@ ts talk to us . &quot;
Well , what does that mean ?
This tri@@ be , the C@@ o@@ f@@ an , has 1@@ 7 v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ties of a@@ y@@ ah@@ u@@ as@@ ca , all of which they dis@@ t@@ ing@@ u@@ ish a great dis@@ t@@ ance in the for@@ est , all of which are re@@ fer@@ able to our e@@ y@@ e as one spec@@ ies .
And then you ask them how they est@@ ab@@ li@@ s@@ h their ta@@ x@@ on@@ om@@ y and they say , &quot; I thought you k@@ new something about plan@@ ts .
I mean , don &apos;t you know anything ? &quot; And I said , &quot; No . &quot;
Well , it tur@@ ns out you take each of the 1@@ 7 v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ties in the ni@@ ght of a f@@ ul@@ l mo@@ on , and it s@@ ings to you in a different k@@ ey .
Now , that &apos;s not going to get you a Ph@@ .@@ D@@ . at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than coun@@ ting st@@ am@@ ens . Now -- -- the problem -- the problem is that even those of us sy@@ m@@ pa@@ the@@ tic with the p@@ light of in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous people vie@@ w them as qu@@ a@@ int and col@@ or@@ ful but som@@ eh@@ ow re@@ duc@@ ed to the mar@@ g@@ ins of hist@@ ory as the real world , me@@ an@@ ing our world , mo@@ ves on .
Well , the tru@@ th is the 20@@ th cent@@ ur@@ y , 3@@ 00 years from now , is not going to be re@@ mem@@ ber@@ ed for its war@@ s or its te@@ chn@@ ologi@@ cal in@@ nov@@ ations , but ra@@ ther as the er@@ a in which we sto@@ od by the m@@ assi@@ ve des@@ tru@@ c@@ tion of bot@@ h bi@@ ologi@@ cal and cul@@ tur@@ al di@@ vers@@ ity on the planet . Now , the problem is@@ n &apos;t change .
All cul@@ tur@@ es through all time have con@@ st@@ ant@@ ly been eng@@ ag@@ ed in a dan@@ ce with new possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ties of life .
And the problem is not technology it@@ self .
The Si@@ ou@@ x Indi@@ ans did not sto@@ p being Si@@ ou@@ x when they ga@@ ve up the b@@ ow and ar@@ ro@@ w any more than an Ameri@@ can st@@ op@@ p@@ ed being an Ameri@@ can when he ga@@ ve up the h@@ or@@ se and bu@@ g@@ g@@ y .
It &apos;s not change or technology that th@@ re@@ at@@ ens the in@@ te@@ g@@ ri@@ ty of the e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ p@@ here . It is power , the c@@ ru@@ de face of d@@ om@@ in@@ ation .
W@@ her@@ ever you look around the world , you dis@@ co@@ ver that these are not cul@@ tur@@ es des@@ tin@@ ed to fa@@ de away ; these are d@@ y@@ nam@@ ic li@@ ving pe@@ op@@ les being dri@@ ven out of ex@@ ist@@ ence by i@@ den@@ ti@@ fi@@ able for@@ ces that are be@@ y@@ on@@ d their cap@@ ac@@ ity to ad@@ ap@@ t to : wh@@ e@@ ther it &apos;s the e@@ gre@@ gi@@ ous de@@ for@@ es@@ ta@@ tion in the h@@ om@@ el@@ and of the P@@ en@@ an -- a n@@ om@@ a@@ di@@ c people from S@@ ou@@ the@@ ast A@@ si@@ a , from S@@ ar@@ a@@ wa@@ k -- a people who li@@ ved f@@ ree in the for@@ est un@@ ti@@ l a gener@@ ation ago ,
and now have all been re@@ duc@@ ed to ser@@ v@@ it@@ u@@ de and pr@@ os@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion on the b@@ an@@ ks of the ri@@ ver@@ s , where you can see the ri@@ ver it@@ self is so@@ il@@ ed with the s@@ il@@ t that se@@ em@@ s to be car@@ r@@ ying hal@@ f of B@@ or@@ ne@@ o away to the S@@ ou@@ th Chin@@ a Se@@ a , where the J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese f@@ rei@@ gh@@ ters h@@ an@@ g light in the h@@ ori@@ z@@ on ready to fil@@ l their hol@@ ds with ra@@ w lo@@ gs ri@@ pp@@ ed from the for@@ est -- or , in the c@@ ase of the Y@@ an@@ om@@ am@@ i ,
it &apos;s the dis@@ e@@ ase enti@@ ties that have come in , in the wa@@ ke of the dis@@ co@@ very of g@@ old .
O@@ r if we go into the mo@@ un@@ ta@@ ins of Ti@@ be@@ t , where I &apos;m doing a lot of res@@ ear@@ ch rec@@ ent@@ ly , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s a c@@ ru@@ de face of poli@@ tical d@@ om@@ in@@ ation .
You know , gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de , the physi@@ cal ex@@ tin@@ c@@ tion of a people is uni@@ vers@@ ally con@@ de@@ m@@ ned , but e@@ th@@ no@@ ci@@ de , the des@@ tru@@ c@@ tion of people &apos;s way of life , is not only not con@@ de@@ m@@ ned , it &apos;s uni@@ vers@@ ally , in many qu@@ ar@@ ters , c@@ el@@ e@@ br@@ ated as part of a develop@@ ment str@@ at@@ eg@@ y .
And you can@@ not understand the pa@@ in of Ti@@ be@@ t un@@ ti@@ l you mo@@ ve through it at the gro@@ und le@@ v@@ el .
I on@@ ce tra@@ v@@ ell@@ ed 6@@ ,000 m@@ il@@ es from Ch@@ eng@@ du in W@@ es@@ tern Chin@@ a o@@ ver@@ land through s@@ ou@@ the@@ ast@@ ern Ti@@ be@@ t to L@@ h@@ as@@ a with a y@@ o@@ ung col@@ le@@ ag@@ ue , and it was only when I got to L@@ h@@ as@@ a that I under@@ sto@@ od the face beh@@ ind the st@@ ati@@ sti@@ c@@ s you he@@ ar about : 6@@ ,000 s@@ ac@@ red mon@@ um@@ ents t@@ or@@ n ap@@ art to d@@ ust and as@@ h@@ es , 1@@ .@@ 2 million people k@@ ill@@ ed by the c@@ ad@@ r@@ es dur@@ ing the C@@ ul@@ tur@@ al R@@ evol@@ ution .
This y@@ o@@ ung man &apos;s fa@@ ther had been as@@ cri@@ b@@ ed to the P@@ an@@ chen L@@ am@@ a .
That me@@ ant he was in@@ st@@ ant@@ ly k@@ ill@@ ed at the time of the Chin@@ ese inv@@ as@@ i@@ on .
H@@ is un@@ c@@ le fl@@ ed with H@@ is H@@ ol@@ iness in the Di@@ as@@ por@@ a that took the people to N@@ ep@@ al .
H@@ is mo@@ ther was in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated for the cri@@ me of being we@@ al@@ th@@ y .
He was sm@@ u@@ g@@ gl@@ ed into the j@@ a@@ il at the age of two to hi@@ de ben@@ e@@ at@@ h her sk@@ ir@@ t ta@@ il@@ s because she cou@@ ldn &apos;t be@@ ar to be with@@ out him .
The s@@ is@@ ter who had done that bra@@ ve de@@ ed was put into an e@@ duc@@ ation c@@ am@@ p .
One day she in@@ ad@@ ver@@ t@@ ent@@ ly ste@@ pp@@ ed on an ar@@ m@@ b@@ and of Ma@@ o , and for that trans@@ g@@ res@@ sion , she was gi@@ ven se@@ ven years of har@@ d l@@ ab@@ or .
The pa@@ in of Ti@@ be@@ t can be im@@ possible to be@@ ar , but the re@@ de@@ mp@@ tive sp@@ ir@@ it of the people is something to beh@@ old .
And in the end , then , it really comes down to a cho@@ ice : do we want to live in a mon@@ o@@ ch@@ ro@@ ma@@ tic world of mon@@ ot@@ on@@ y or do we want to em@@ bra@@ ce a p@@ ol@@ y@@ ch@@ ro@@ ma@@ tic world of di@@ vers@@ ity ?
Mar@@ g@@ ar@@ et Me@@ ad , the great an@@ th@@ rop@@ olog@@ ist , said , before she di@@ ed , that her gre@@ at@@ est fe@@ ar was that as we dri@@ f@@ ted to@@ war@@ ds this bl@@ and@@ ly am@@ or@@ ph@@ ous gen@@ eri@@ c world vie@@ w not only would we see the enti@@ re ran@@ ge of the human ima@@ g@@ in@@ ation re@@ duc@@ ed to a more n@@ ar@@ ro@@ w mo@@ d@@ ality of thought , but that we would wa@@ ke from a dre@@ am one day ha@@ ving for@@ g@@ ot@@ ten there were even other possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ties .
And it &apos;s hum@@ bl@@ ing to re@@ mem@@ ber that our spec@@ ies has , per@@ h@@ ap@@ s , been around for &#91; 1@@ 5@@ 0@@ ,000 &#93; years .
The Ne@@ o@@ li@@ th@@ ic R@@ evol@@ ution -- which ga@@ ve us ag@@ ri@@ cul@@ ture , at which time we su@@ c@@ c@@ um@@ b@@ ed to the cul@@ t of the se@@ ed ; the po@@ et@@ ry of the sh@@ am@@ an was dis@@ plac@@ ed by the pr@@ ose of the pri@@ es@@ th@@ o@@ od ; we cre@@ ated hi@@ er@@ ar@@ ch@@ y spec@@ i@@ ali@@ z@@ ation sur@@ pl@@ us -- is only 10@@ ,000 years ago .
The mo@@ dern in@@ du@@ stri@@ al world as we know it is bar@@ ely 3@@ 00 years old .
Now , that sh@@ al@@ low hist@@ ory doesn &apos;t su@@ g@@ ges@@ t to me that we have all the ans@@ wer@@ s for all of the ch@@ all@@ en@@ ges that will con@@ f@@ ron@@ t us in the en@@ su@@ ing m@@ ill@@ en@@ ni@@ a .
When these my@@ ri@@ ad cul@@ tur@@ es of the world are as@@ ked the me@@ an@@ ing of being human , they res@@ pon@@ d with 10@@ ,000 different v@@ o@@ ic@@ es .
And it &apos;s with@@ in that s@@ ong that we will all re@@ dis@@ co@@ ver the possi@@ bi@@ li@@ ty of being what we are : a f@@ ul@@ ly con@@ sci@@ ous spec@@ ies , f@@ ul@@ ly a@@ w@@ are of en@@ sur@@ ing that all pe@@ op@@ les and all g@@ ar@@ den@@ s find a way to fl@@ our@@ ish . And there are great m@@ om@@ ents of op@@ tim@@ is@@ m .
This is a ph@@ ot@@ ograp@@ h I took at the nor@@ th@@ ern ti@@ p of B@@ aff@@ in I@@ s@@ land when I went n@@ ar@@ wh@@ al h@@ un@@ ting with some In@@ u@@ it people , and this man , O@@ la@@ y@@ u@@ k , t@@ old me a mar@@ vel@@ ous story of his gr@@ and@@ fa@@ ther .
The C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an go@@ vern@@ ment has not always been kind to the In@@ u@@ it people , and dur@@ ing the 19@@ 5@@ 0@@ s , to est@@ ab@@ li@@ s@@ h our so@@ ver@@ ei@@ g@@ n@@ ty , we for@@ c@@ ed them into s@@ et@@ t@@ le@@ m@@ ents .
This old man &apos;s gr@@ and@@ fa@@ ther re@@ f@@ used to go .
The fam@@ ily , f@@ ear@@ ful for his life , took away all of his we@@ ap@@ ons , all of his to@@ ol@@ s .
Now , you m@@ ust understand that the In@@ u@@ it did not fe@@ ar the c@@ old ; they took ad@@ v@@ an@@ ta@@ ge of it .
The r@@ un@@ n@@ ers of their s@@ le@@ ds were or@@ ig@@ in@@ ally made of f@@ ish w@@ r@@ app@@ ed in c@@ ari@@ b@@ ou hi@@ de .
So , this man &apos;s gr@@ and@@ fa@@ ther was not in@@ ti@@ mi@@ d@@ ated by the Ar@@ c@@ tic ni@@ ght or the b@@ li@@ z@@ z@@ ard that was blo@@ wing .
He sim@@ p@@ ly s@@ li@@ pp@@ ed out@@ side , p@@ ul@@ l@@ ed down his se@@ al@@ sk@@ in tr@@ ous@@ ers and de@@ f@@ ec@@ ated into his h@@ and . And as the f@@ ec@@ es beg@@ an to fre@@ e@@ ze , he sh@@ ap@@ ed it into the form of a b@@ la@@ de .
He put a sp@@ ra@@ y of s@@ ali@@ v@@ a on the e@@ dge of the sh@@ it k@@ ni@@ fe and as it fin@@ ally f@@ ro@@ ze so@@ li@@ d , he b@@ ut@@ cher@@ ed a do@@ g with it .
He sk@@ inn@@ ed the do@@ g and im@@ pro@@ vis@@ ed a har@@ ness , took the ri@@ b@@ c@@ age of the do@@ g and im@@ pro@@ vis@@ ed a s@@ l@@ ed , har@@ n@@ ess@@ ed up an ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent do@@ g , and dis@@ ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed over the ice flo@@ es , sh@@ it k@@ ni@@ fe in b@@ elt .
Talk about getting by with no@@ thing . And this , in many ways -- -- is a sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of the res@@ ili@@ ence of the In@@ u@@ it people and of all in@@ di@@ gen@@ ous people around the world .
The C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an go@@ vern@@ ment in A@@ pri@@ l of 19@@ 9@@ 9 ga@@ ve back to t@@ ot@@ al con@@ tro@@ l of the In@@ u@@ it an are@@ a of land lar@@ ger than C@@ ali@@ for@@ ni@@ a and T@@ ex@@ as put together .
It &apos;s our new h@@ om@@ el@@ and . It &apos;s called N@@ un@@ av@@ ut .
It &apos;s an in@@ de@@ p@@ end@@ ent ter@@ rit@@ ory . They con@@ tro@@ l all min@@ er@@ al res@@ our@@ ces .
A@@ n a@@ ma@@ zing example of how a n@@ ation@@ -@@ st@@ ate can se@@ e@@ k res@@ ti@@ tu@@ tion with its people .
And fin@@ ally , in the end , I think it &apos;s pretty ob@@ vi@@ ous at le@@ ast to all of all us who &apos;ve tra@@ vel@@ ed in these re@@ mo@@ te re@@ ach@@ es of the planet , to re@@ ali@@ ze that they &apos;re not re@@ mo@@ te at all .
They &apos;re h@@ om@@ el@@ and@@ s of some@@ body .
They re@@ pres@@ ent br@@ an@@ ches of the human ima@@ g@@ in@@ ation that go back to the da@@ wn of time . And for all of us , the dre@@ am@@ s of these children , like the dre@@ am@@ s of our own children , be@@ come part of the n@@ ak@@ ed ge@@ ograp@@ h@@ y of hop@@ e .
So , what we &apos;re trying to do at the N@@ ational Ge@@ ograp@@ hi@@ c , fin@@ ally , is , we believe that poli@@ ti@@ ci@@ ans will never ac@@ comp@@ li@@ s@@ h anything .
We think that p@@ ol@@ em@@ ic@@ s -- -- we think that p@@ ol@@ em@@ ic@@ s are not per@@ su@@ as@@ i@@ ve , but we think that stor@@ y@@ tell@@ ing can change the world , and so we are probably the best stor@@ y@@ tell@@ ing in@@ sti@@ tu@@ tion in the world . We get 3@@ 5 million h@@ its on our we@@ b@@ si@@ te every mon@@ th .
1@@ 5@@ 6 n@@ ations car@@ ry our tel@@ ev@@ isi@@ on chan@@ ne@@ l .
O@@ ur ma@@ ga@@ z@@ in@@ es are re@@ ad by m@@ illi@@ ons .
And what we &apos;re doing is a s@@ eri@@ es of j@@ our@@ ne@@ ys to the e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ p@@ here where we &apos;re going to take our au@@ di@@ ence to plac@@ es of such cul@@ tur@@ al w@@ on@@ der that they can@@ not help but come away da@@ z@@ z@@ l@@ ed by what they have se@@ en , and hop@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly , ther@@ e@@ fore , em@@ bra@@ ce gra@@ du@@ ally , one by one , the cent@@ ra@@ l re@@ vel@@ ation of an@@ th@@ rop@@ olog@@ y : that this world des@@ er@@ ves to ex@@ ist in a di@@ verse way , that we can find a way to live in a tru@@ ly m@@ ul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tur@@ al , pl@@ ur@@ alis@@ tic world
where all of the wis@@ do@@ m of all pe@@ op@@ les can con@@ tri@@ bu@@ te to our col@@ lec@@ tive w@@ ell@@ -@@ being .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m going to talk to you about some stuff that &apos;s in this book of m@@ ine that I hop@@ e will res@@ on@@ ate with other things you &apos;ve al@@ ready hear@@ d , and I &apos;ll try to make some connec@@ tions my@@ self , in c@@ ase you mis@@ s@@ ed them .
But I want to start with what I call the &quot; off@@ ic@@ i@@ al do@@ g@@ ma . &quot;
The off@@ ic@@ i@@ al do@@ g@@ ma of what ?
The off@@ ic@@ i@@ al do@@ g@@ ma of all W@@ es@@ tern in@@ du@@ stri@@ al soci@@ e@@ ties .
And the off@@ ic@@ i@@ al do@@ g@@ ma r@@ uns like this : if we are interes@@ ted in ma@@ x@@ im@@ i@@ zing the wel@@ f@@ are of our ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens , the way to do that is to ma@@ x@@ im@@ i@@ ze in@@ di@@ vi@@ du@@ al fre@@ e@@ do@@ m .
The reas@@ on for this is bot@@ h that fre@@ e@@ do@@ m is in and of it@@ self good , val@@ u@@ able , wor@@ th@@ whi@@ le , ess@@ enti@@ al to being human .
And because if people have fre@@ e@@ do@@ m , then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will ma@@ x@@ im@@ i@@ ze our wel@@ f@@ are , and no one has to de@@ ci@@ de on our beh@@ al@@ f .
The way to ma@@ x@@ im@@ i@@ ze fre@@ e@@ do@@ m is to ma@@ x@@ im@@ i@@ ze cho@@ ice .
The more cho@@ ice people have , the more fre@@ e@@ do@@ m they have , and the more fre@@ e@@ do@@ m they have , the more wel@@ f@@ are they have .
This , I think , is so de@@ ep@@ ly em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in the water supp@@ ly that it w@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t o@@ c@@ c@@ ur to any@@ one to question it .
And it &apos;s also de@@ ep@@ ly em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in our li@@ ves .
I &apos;ll give you some exam@@ pl@@ es of what mo@@ dern pro@@ g@@ res@@ s has made possible for us .
This is my su@@ per@@ mark@@ et . N@@ ot such a big one .
I want to say just a wor@@ d about s@@ al@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ing .
1@@ 7@@ 5 s@@ al@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ings in my su@@ per@@ mark@@ et , if you don &apos;t coun@@ t the 10 ex@@ tra@@ -@@ vir@@ g@@ in o@@ live o@@ il@@ s and 1@@ 2 b@@ al@@ sam@@ ic v@@ in@@ eg@@ ars you could bu@@ y to make a very lar@@ ge number of your own s@@ al@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ings , in the off@@ -@@ chan@@ ce that n@@ one of the 1@@ 7@@ 5 the st@@ ore has on off@@ er su@@ it you .
So this is what the su@@ per@@ mark@@ et is like .
And then you go to the con@@ su@@ mer elec@@ tr@@ on@@ ic@@ s st@@ ore to set up a ster@@ e@@ o system -- spe@@ ak@@ ers , C@@ D pla@@ y@@ er , t@@ ap@@ e pla@@ y@@ er , t@@ un@@ er , am@@ p@@ li@@ fi@@ er -- and in this one s@@ ing@@ le con@@ su@@ mer elec@@ tr@@ on@@ ic@@ s st@@ ore , there are that many ster@@ e@@ o sy@@ stem@@ s .
We can con@@ struc@@ t si@@ x@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ hal@@ f@@ -@@ million different ster@@ e@@ o sy@@ stem@@ s out of the comp@@ on@@ ents that are on off@@ er in one st@@ ore .
You &apos;ve got to ad@@ mit that &apos;s a lot of cho@@ ice .
In other d@@ om@@ a@@ ins -- the world of comm@@ un@@ ic@@ ations .
There was a time , when I was a bo@@ y , when you could get any kind of tel@@ e@@ ph@@ one ser@@ vi@@ ce you wanted , as long as it came from M@@ a B@@ ell .
You r@@ ent@@ ed your ph@@ one . You didn &apos;t bu@@ y it .
One con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of that , by the way , is that the ph@@ one never bro@@ ke .
And those da@@ ys are g@@ one .
We now have an al@@ most un@@ li@@ mit@@ ed v@@ ari@@ et@@ y of ph@@ ones , es@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ ally in the world of c@@ ell ph@@ ones .
These are c@@ ell ph@@ ones of the future .
My fa@@ vor@@ i@@ te is the mi@@ dd@@ le one -- the M@@ P@@ 3 pla@@ y@@ er , n@@ ose ha@@ ir tri@@ m@@ mer , and c@@ r@@ è@@ me br@@ û@@ l@@ é@@ e t@@ or@@ ch .
And if by some chan@@ ce you ha@@ ven &apos;t se@@ en that in your st@@ ore y@@ et , you can res@@ t as@@ su@@ red that one day so@@ on , you will .
And what this does is it lea@@ ds people to w@@ alk into their stor@@ es as@@ king this question .
And do you know what the ans@@ wer to this question now is ?
The ans@@ wer is &quot; no . &quot;
It is not possible to bu@@ y a c@@ ell ph@@ one that doesn &apos;t do too much .
So , in other as@@ p@@ ects of life that are much more sig@@ ni@@ f@@ ic@@ ant than bu@@ ying things , the same ex@@ pl@@ os@@ i@@ on of cho@@ ice is tr@@ ue .
H@@ e@@ al@@ th c@@ are . It is no l@@ on@@ ger the c@@ ase in the Un@@ ited St@@ ates that you go to the do@@ c@@ tor , and the do@@ c@@ tor tell@@ s you what to do .
In@@ ste@@ ad , you go to the do@@ c@@ tor , and the do@@ c@@ tor tell@@ s you , &quot; Well , we could do A , or we could do B .
A has these ben@@ ef@@ its , and these ris@@ ks .
B has these ben@@ ef@@ its , and these ris@@ ks . What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; D@@ o@@ c , what should I do ? &quot;
And the do@@ c says , &quot; A has these ben@@ ef@@ its and ris@@ ks , and B has these ben@@ ef@@ its and ris@@ ks .
What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; If you were me , D@@ o@@ c , what would you do ? &quot;
And the do@@ c says , &quot; But I &apos;m not you . &quot;
And the res@@ ul@@ t is -- we call it &quot; pa@@ ti@@ ent au@@ t@@ on@@ om@@ y , &quot; which ma@@ kes it so@@ und like a good thing , but it really is a shi@@ f@@ ting of the b@@ ur@@ den and the res@@ pon@@ si@@ bi@@ li@@ ty for de@@ c@@ isi@@ on@@ -@@ making from some@@ body who kno@@ ws something -- nam@@ ely , the do@@ c@@ tor -- to some@@ body who kno@@ ws no@@ thing and is al@@ most cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly si@@ ck and th@@ us not in the best sh@@ ap@@ e to be making de@@ c@@ isi@@ ons -- nam@@ ely , the pa@@ ti@@ ent .
There &apos;s en@@ or@@ m@@ ous mark@@ et@@ ing of pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tion dru@@ gs to people like you and me , which , if you think about it , ma@@ kes no sense at all , sin@@ ce we can &apos;t bu@@ y them .
Wh@@ y do they mark@@ et to us if we can &apos;t bu@@ y them ?
The ans@@ wer is that they exp@@ ect us to call our do@@ c@@ t@@ ors the next mor@@ ning and ask for our pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tions to be chan@@ g@@ ed .
S@@ om@@ e@@ thing as dra@@ ma@@ tic as our i@@ den@@ ti@@ ty has now be@@ come a mat@@ ter of cho@@ ice , as this s@@ li@@ de is me@@ ant to in@@ dic@@ ate .
We don &apos;t in@@ her@@ it an i@@ den@@ ti@@ ty ; we get to inv@@ ent it .
And we get to re@@ -@@ inv@@ ent our@@ selves as o@@ ften as we like .
And that means that every day , when you wa@@ ke up in the mor@@ ning , you have to de@@ ci@@ de what kind of person you want to be .
W@@ it@@ h res@@ p@@ ect to mar@@ ri@@ age and fam@@ ily , there was a time when the de@@ f@@ au@@ lt as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion that al@@ most every@@ one had is that you got mar@@ ri@@ ed as so@@ on as you could , and then you started ha@@ ving kids as so@@ on as you could .
The only real cho@@ ice was who , not when , and not what you did after .
N@@ o@@ wa@@ da@@ ys , everything is very much up for gr@@ ab@@ s .
I te@@ ach w@@ onder@@ f@@ ul@@ ly in@@ tel@@ li@@ g@@ ent stu@@ d@@ ents , and I assi@@ g@@ n 20 percent less work than I used to .
And it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less s@@ mar@@ t , and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less di@@ li@@ g@@ ent .
It &apos;s because they are pre@@ o@@ c@@ c@@ u@@ pi@@ ed , as@@ king the@@ m@@ selves , &quot; S@@ h@@ ould I get mar@@ ri@@ ed or not ? S@@ h@@ ould I get mar@@ ri@@ ed now ?
S@@ h@@ ould I get mar@@ ri@@ ed l@@ ater ? S@@ h@@ ould I have kids first , or a car@@ e@@ er first ? &quot;
All of these are con@@ su@@ m@@ ing ques@@ tions .
And they &apos;re going to ans@@ wer these ques@@ tions , wh@@ e@@ ther or not it means not doing all the work I assi@@ g@@ n and not getting a good gra@@ de in my cour@@ s@@ es .
And in@@ de@@ ed they should . These are important ques@@ tions to ans@@ wer .
Wor@@ k -- we are bl@@ ess@@ ed , as C@@ ar@@ l was po@@ in@@ ting out , with the technology that en@@ ab@@ les us to work every min@@ ute of every day from any place on the planet -- ex@@ ce@@ pt the R@@ and@@ ol@@ p@@ h H@@ ot@@ el .
There is one cor@@ ner , by the way , that I &apos;m not going to tell any@@ body about , where the Wi@@ F@@ i actually wor@@ ks .
I &apos;m not tell@@ ing you about it because I want to use it .
So what this means , this incre@@ di@@ ble fre@@ e@@ do@@ m of cho@@ ice we have with res@@ p@@ ect to work , is that we have to make a de@@ c@@ isi@@ on , again and again and again , about wh@@ e@@ ther we should or sh@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t be working .
We can go to wat@@ ch our k@@ id play so@@ c@@ c@@ er , and we have our c@@ ell ph@@ one on one hi@@ p , and our B@@ l@@ ack@@ ber@@ ry on our other hi@@ p , and our l@@ ap@@ top , pres@@ um@@ ab@@ ly , on our l@@ ap@@ s .
And even if they &apos;re all sh@@ ut off , every min@@ ute that we &apos;re wat@@ ch@@ ing our k@@ id m@@ u@@ ti@@ l@@ ate a so@@ c@@ c@@ er g@@ ame , we are also as@@ king our@@ selves , &quot; S@@ h@@ ould I ans@@ wer this c@@ ell ph@@ one call ?
S@@ h@@ ould I res@@ pon@@ d to this e@@ ma@@ il ? S@@ h@@ ould I dra@@ ft this let@@ ter ? &quot;
And even if the ans@@ wer to the question is &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly going to make the experi@@ ence of your k@@ id &apos;s so@@ c@@ c@@ er g@@ ame very different than it would &apos;ve been .
So every@@ where we look , big things and small things , mat@@ eri@@ al things and li@@ f@@ est@@ y@@ le things , life is a mat@@ ter of cho@@ ice .
And the world we used to live in loo@@ ked like this .
That is to say , there were some cho@@ ic@@ es , but not everything was a mat@@ ter of cho@@ ice .
And the world we now live in loo@@ ks like this .
And the question is , is this good ne@@ ws , or b@@ ad ne@@ ws ?
And the ans@@ wer is , &quot; y@@ es . &quot;
We all know what &apos;s good about it , so I &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s b@@ ad about it .
All of this cho@@ ice has two eff@@ ects , two ne@@ g@@ ative eff@@ ects on people .
One eff@@ ect , par@@ a@@ do@@ x@@ ically , is that it produc@@ es par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is , ra@@ ther than li@@ ber@@ ation .
W@@ it@@ h so many op@@ tions to cho@@ ose from , people find it very diff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t to cho@@ ose at all .
I &apos;ll give you one very dra@@ ma@@ tic example of this : a stu@@ dy that was done of inv@@ est@@ m@@ ents in vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment pl@@ ans .
A col@@ le@@ ag@@ ue of m@@ ine got ac@@ cess to inv@@ est@@ ment rec@@ or@@ ds from V@@ an@@ gu@@ ard , the gi@@ gan@@ tic m@@ u@@ tu@@ al@@ -@@ f@@ und comp@@ any of about a million em@@ p@@ lo@@ ye@@ es and about 2@@ ,000 different wor@@ k@@ plac@@ es .
And what she found is that for every 10 m@@ u@@ tu@@ al f@@ un@@ ds the em@@ p@@ lo@@ y@@ er off@@ er@@ ed , ra@@ te of par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ation went down two percent .
You off@@ er 50 f@@ un@@ ds -- 10 percent fe@@ wer em@@ p@@ lo@@ ye@@ es par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate than if you only off@@ er five . Wh@@ y ?
Because with 50 f@@ un@@ ds to cho@@ ose from , it &apos;s so dam@@ n har@@ d to de@@ ci@@ de which f@@ und to cho@@ ose , that you &apos;ll just put it off un@@ ti@@ l t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w .
And then t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w , and t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w , and t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w , and of course t@@ om@@ or@@ ro@@ w never comes .
Un@@ der@@ stand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to e@@ at do@@ g food when they re@@ ti@@ re because they don &apos;t have enough money put away , it also means that making the de@@ c@@ isi@@ on is so har@@ d that they p@@ ass up sig@@ ni@@ f@@ ic@@ ant mat@@ ch@@ ing money from the em@@ p@@ lo@@ y@@ er .
B@@ y not par@@ ti@@ ci@@ p@@ ating , they are p@@ ass@@ ing up as much as 5@@ ,000 dollars a year from the em@@ p@@ lo@@ y@@ er , who would happ@@ ily mat@@ ch their con@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion .
So par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is is a con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of ha@@ ving too many cho@@ ic@@ es .
And I think it ma@@ kes the world look like this . &#91; And la@@ st@@ ly , for all e@@ ter@@ n@@ ity , Fr@@ en@@ ch , ble@@ u ch@@ e@@ ese , or ran@@ ch ? &#93; You really want to get the de@@ c@@ isi@@ on right if it &apos;s for all e@@ ter@@ n@@ ity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to pic@@ k the w@@ r@@ ong m@@ u@@ tu@@ al f@@ und , or the w@@ r@@ ong s@@ al@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ing .
So that &apos;s one eff@@ ect . The second eff@@ ect is that even if we man@@ age to o@@ ver@@ come the par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is and make a cho@@ ice , we end up less sa@@ ti@@ s@@ fi@@ ed with the res@@ ul@@ t of the cho@@ ice than we would be if we had fe@@ wer op@@ tions to cho@@ ose from .
And there are se@@ ver@@ al reas@@ ons for this .
is that with a lot of different s@@ al@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ings to cho@@ ose from , if you bu@@ y one , and it &apos;s not per@@ f@@ ect -- and what s@@ al@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ing is ? -- it &apos;s eas@@ y to ima@@ g@@ ine you could have made a different cho@@ ice that would have been better . And what happ@@ ens is this ima@@ g@@ in@@ ed al@@ ter@@ n@@ ative in@@ duc@@ es you to re@@ gre@@ t the de@@ c@@ isi@@ on you made , and this re@@ gre@@ t sub@@ tra@@ c@@ ts from the sa@@ ti@@ s@@ fac@@ tion you get out of the de@@ c@@ isi@@ on you made ,
even if it was a good de@@ c@@ isi@@ on .
The more op@@ tions there are , the eas@@ ier it is to re@@ gre@@ t anything at all that is dis@@ ap@@ po@@ in@@ ting about the op@@ tion that you ch@@ ose .
S@@ econ@@ d , what econom@@ is@@ ts call &quot; op@@ port@@ unity c@@ os@@ ts . &quot;
D@@ an G@@ il@@ ber@@ t made a big point this mor@@ ning of talking about how much the way in which we val@@ ue things de@@ p@@ ends on what we comp@@ are them to .
Well , when there are l@@ ots of al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ ves to con@@ si@@ der , it is eas@@ y to ima@@ g@@ ine the at@@ tra@@ c@@ tive fe@@ at@@ ur@@ es of al@@ ter@@ n@@ ati@@ ves that you re@@ ject that make you less sa@@ ti@@ s@@ fi@@ ed with the al@@ ter@@ n@@ ative that you &apos;ve ch@@ os@@ en .
Here &apos;s an example . &#91; I can &apos;t sto@@ p thinking about those other av@@ a@@ il@@ able par@@ king sp@@ ac@@ es on W 8@@ 5@@ th stre@@ et &#93; S@@ or@@ ry if you &apos;re not New Yor@@ k@@ ers .
Here &apos;s what you &apos;re supp@@ os@@ ed to be thinking .
Here &apos;s this cou@@ ple on the H@@ am@@ p@@ t@@ ons .
Ver@@ y exp@@ ensi@@ ve real es@@ ta@@ te .
G@@ or@@ ge@@ ous be@@ ach . Be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful day . They have it all to the@@ m@@ selves .
What could be better ?
&quot; Well , dam@@ n it , &quot; this gu@@ y is thinking , &quot; It &apos;s Au@@ g@@ ust . E@@ very@@ body in my M@@ an@@ hat@@ t@@ an n@@ ei@@ gh@@ bor@@ ho@@ od is away .
I could be par@@ king right in f@@ ron@@ t of my building . &quot;
And he sp@@ ends two we@@ e@@ ks n@@ ag@@ g@@ ed by the idea that he is mis@@ s@@ ing the op@@ port@@ unity , day after day , to have a great par@@ king space .
sub@@ tra@@ c@@ t from the sa@@ ti@@ s@@ fac@@ tion we get out of what we cho@@ ose , even when what we cho@@ ose is ter@@ ri@@ fi@@ c .
And the more op@@ tions there are to con@@ si@@ der , the more at@@ tra@@ c@@ tive fe@@ at@@ ur@@ es of these op@@ tions are going to be re@@ f@@ lec@@ ted by us as op@@ port@@ unity c@@ os@@ ts .
Here &apos;s another example .
Now this car@@ to@@ on ma@@ kes a lot of po@@ in@@ ts .
It ma@@ kes po@@ in@@ ts about li@@ ving in the m@@ oment as well , and probably about doing things s@@ lo@@ w@@ ly .
But one point it ma@@ kes is that wh@@ en@@ ever you &apos;re cho@@ os@@ ing one thing , you &apos;re cho@@ os@@ ing not to do other things that may have l@@ ots of at@@ tra@@ c@@ tive fe@@ at@@ ur@@ es , and it &apos;s going to make what you &apos;re doing less at@@ tra@@ c@@ tive .
Th@@ ir@@ d : es@@ c@@ al@@ ation of exp@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions .
This h@@ it me when I went to re@@ place my je@@ ans .
I we@@ ar je@@ ans al@@ most all the time .
There was a time when je@@ ans came in one f@@ la@@ vor , and you b@@ ou@@ ght them , and they f@@ it like cra@@ p , they were incre@@ di@@ b@@ ly un@@ com@@ for@@ t@@ able , if you wor@@ e them and w@@ as@@ h@@ ed them enough times , they started to feel OK .
I went to re@@ place my je@@ ans after years of we@@ ar@@ ing these old ones , and I said , &quot; I want a pa@@ ir of je@@ ans . Here &apos;s my si@@ ze . &quot;
And the sh@@ op@@ ke@@ ep@@ er said , &quot; D@@ o you want s@@ li@@ m f@@ it , eas@@ y f@@ it , rel@@ a@@ x@@ ed f@@ it ?
You want b@@ ut@@ ton f@@ ly or zi@@ pp@@ er f@@ ly ? You want st@@ on@@ e@@ w@@ as@@ h@@ ed or ac@@ i@@ d@@ -@@ w@@ as@@ h@@ ed ?
D@@ o you want them dis@@ tr@@ ess@@ ed ?
You want bo@@ ot c@@ ut , t@@ ap@@ er@@ ed , b@@ la@@ h b@@ la@@ h . &quot; O@@ n and on he went .
My j@@ a@@ w dro@@ pp@@ ed . And after I re@@ co@@ ver@@ ed , I said , &quot; I want the kind that used to be the only kind . &quot;
He had no idea what that was , so I sp@@ ent an h@@ our trying on all these dam@@ n je@@ ans , and I w@@ al@@ ked out of the st@@ ore -- tru@@ th ! -- with the best@@ -@@ f@@ it@@ ting je@@ ans I had ever had .
I did better . All this cho@@ ice made it possible for me to do better .
But -- I f@@ elt wor@@ se .
Wh@@ y ? I w@@ ro@@ te a whole book to try to ex@@ pl@@ ain this to my@@ self .
The reas@@ on I f@@ elt wor@@ se is that , with all of these op@@ tions av@@ a@@ il@@ able , my exp@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions about how good a pa@@ ir of je@@ ans should be went up .
I had very low , no partic@@ ular exp@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions when they only came in one f@@ la@@ vor .
When they came in 100 f@@ la@@ vor@@ s , dam@@ n it , one of them should &apos;ve been per@@ f@@ ect .
And what I got was good , but it w@@ as@@ n &apos;t per@@ f@@ ect .
And so I com@@ par@@ ed what I got to what I exp@@ ec@@ ted , and what I got was dis@@ ap@@ po@@ in@@ ting in com@@ par@@ is@@ on to what I exp@@ ec@@ ted .
A@@ d@@ ding op@@ tions to people &apos;s li@@ ves can &apos;t help but incre@@ ase the exp@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions people have about how good those op@@ tions will be .
And what that &apos;s going to produ@@ ce is less sa@@ ti@@ s@@ fac@@ tion with res@@ ul@@ ts , even when they &apos;re good res@@ ul@@ ts .
N@@ o@@ body in the world of mark@@ et@@ ing kno@@ ws this .
&#91; It all loo@@ ks so great . I can &apos;t wa@@ it to be dis@@ ap@@ po@@ in@@ ted . &#93; Because if they did , you w@@ ou@@ ldn &apos;t all know what this was about .
The tru@@ th is more like this .
&#91; E@@ very@@ thing was better back when everything was wor@@ se &#93; The reas@@ on that everything was better back when everything was wor@@ se is that when everything was wor@@ se , it was actually possible for people to have experi@@ en@@ ces that were a ple@@ as@@ ant sur@@ pr@@ is@@ e .
N@@ o@@ wa@@ da@@ ys , the world we live in -- we aff@@ lu@@ ent , in@@ du@@ stri@@ ali@@ zed ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens , with per@@ f@@ ec@@ tion the exp@@ ec@@ ta@@ tion -- the best you can ever hop@@ e for is that stuff is as good as you exp@@ ect it to be .
You will never be ple@@ as@@ ant@@ ly sur@@ pr@@ is@@ ed because your exp@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions , my exp@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions , have g@@ one through the ro@@ of .
The s@@ ec@@ re@@ t to happ@@ iness -- this is what you all came for -- the s@@ ec@@ re@@ t to happ@@ iness is low exp@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions .
I want to say -- just a little au@@ to@@ bi@@ ograp@@ hi@@ cal m@@ oment -- that I actually am mar@@ ri@@ ed to a wi@@ fe , and she &apos;s really quite w@@ onder@@ ful .
I cou@@ ldn &apos;t have done better . I didn &apos;t s@@ et@@ t@@ le .
But s@@ et@@ t@@ l@@ ing is@@ n &apos;t always such a b@@ ad thing .
F@@ in@@ ally -- One con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of bu@@ ying a b@@ ad@@ -@@ f@@ it@@ ting pa@@ ir of je@@ ans when there is only one kind to bu@@ y is that when you are dis@@ sa@@ ti@@ s@@ fi@@ ed , and you ask why , who &apos;s res@@ pon@@ si@@ ble , the ans@@ wer is cle@@ ar : the world is res@@ pon@@ si@@ ble .
What could you do ?
When there are h@@ und@@ re@@ ds of different st@@ y@@ les of je@@ ans av@@ a@@ il@@ able , and you bu@@ y one that is dis@@ ap@@ po@@ in@@ ting , and you ask why , who &apos;s res@@ pon@@ si@@ ble ?
It is e@@ qu@@ ally cle@@ ar that the ans@@ wer to the question is &quot; you . &quot;
You could have done better .
W@@ it@@ h a h@@ und@@ red different kin@@ ds of je@@ ans on dis@@ play , there is no ex@@ c@@ use for fa@@ il@@ ure .
And so when people make de@@ c@@ isi@@ ons , and even th@@ ough the res@@ ul@@ ts of the de@@ c@@ isi@@ ons are good , they feel dis@@ ap@@ po@@ in@@ ted about them ; they bl@@ ame the@@ m@@ selves .
C@@ lin@@ ic@@ al de@@ pres@@ sion has exp@@ lo@@ ded in the in@@ du@@ stri@@ al world in the last gener@@ ation .
I believe a sig@@ ni@@ f@@ ic@@ ant -- not the only , but a sig@@ ni@@ f@@ ic@@ ant -- con@@ tri@@ b@@ ut@@ or to this ex@@ pl@@ os@@ i@@ on of de@@ pres@@ sion , and also su@@ ic@@ i@@ de , is that people have experi@@ en@@ ces that are dis@@ ap@@ po@@ in@@ ting because their stand@@ ar@@ ds are so hi@@ gh , and then when they have to ex@@ pl@@ ain these experi@@ en@@ ces to the@@ m@@ selves , they think they &apos;re at f@@ au@@ lt .
And so the net res@@ ul@@ t is that we do better in gener@@ al , ob@@ j@@ ec@@ tiv@@ ely , and we feel wor@@ se .
So let me re@@ m@@ ind you .
This is the off@@ ic@@ i@@ al do@@ g@@ ma , the one that we all take to be tr@@ ue , and it &apos;s all f@@ al@@ se . It is not tr@@ ue .
There &apos;s no question that some cho@@ ice is better than n@@ one , but it doesn &apos;t fol@@ low from that that more cho@@ ice is better than some cho@@ ice .
There &apos;s some ma@@ gi@@ cal am@@ o@@ un@@ t . I don &apos;t know what it is .
I &apos;m pretty con@@ fi@@ d@@ ent that we have long sin@@ ce p@@ ass@@ ed the point where op@@ tions im@@ pro@@ ve our wel@@ f@@ are .
Now , as a po@@ lic@@ y mat@@ ter -- I &apos;m al@@ most done -- as a po@@ lic@@ y mat@@ ter , the thing to think about is this : what en@@ ab@@ les all of this cho@@ ice in in@@ du@@ stri@@ al soci@@ e@@ ties is mat@@ eri@@ al aff@@ lu@@ ence .
There are l@@ ots of plac@@ es in the world , and we have hear@@ d about se@@ ver@@ al of them , where their problem is not that they have too much cho@@ ice .
Th@@ ei@@ r problem is that they have too little .
So the stuff I &apos;m talking about is the p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar problem of mo@@ dern , aff@@ lu@@ ent , W@@ es@@ tern soci@@ e@@ ties .
And what is so f@@ ru@@ str@@ ating and in@@ fu@@ ri@@ ating is this : S@@ te@@ ve L@@ ev@@ it@@ t tal@@ ked to you y@@ es@@ ter@@ day about how these exp@@ ensi@@ ve and diff@@ ic@@ ul@@ t@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ in@@ st@@ all ch@@ ild se@@ at@@ s don &apos;t help .
It &apos;s a wa@@ ste of money .
What I &apos;m tell@@ ing you is that these exp@@ ensi@@ ve , comp@@ lic@@ ated cho@@ ic@@ es -- it &apos;s not sim@@ p@@ ly that they don &apos;t help .
They actually h@@ ur@@ t .
They actually make us wor@@ se off .
If some of what en@@ ab@@ les people in our soci@@ e@@ ties to make all of the cho@@ ic@@ es we make were shi@@ f@@ ted to soci@@ e@@ ties in which people have too few op@@ tions , not only would those people &apos;s li@@ ves be im@@ pro@@ ved , but our@@ s would be im@@ pro@@ ved also , which is what econom@@ is@@ ts call a &quot; Par@@ et@@ o@@ -@@ im@@ pro@@ ving mo@@ ve . &quot;
In@@ come re@@ dis@@ tri@@ bu@@ tion will make every@@ one better off -- not just po@@ or people -- because of how all this ex@@ cess cho@@ ice pl@@ ag@@ u@@ es us .
So to con@@ c@@ lu@@ de . &#91; You can be anything you want to be -- no li@@ mit@@ s &#93; You &apos;re supp@@ os@@ ed to re@@ ad this car@@ to@@ on , and , being a s@@ op@@ h@@ is@@ tic@@ ated person , say , &quot; A@@ h ! What does this f@@ ish know ?
You know , no@@ thing is possible in this f@@ is@@ h@@ bo@@ w@@ l . &quot;
I@@ m@@ po@@ ver@@ is@@ h@@ ed ima@@ g@@ in@@ ation , a my@@ op@@ ic vie@@ w of the world -- and that &apos;s the way I re@@ ad it at first .
The more I thought about it , ho@@ we@@ ver , the more I came to the vie@@ w that this f@@ ish kno@@ ws something .
Because the tru@@ th of the mat@@ ter is that if you sh@@ at@@ ter the f@@ is@@ h@@ bo@@ w@@ l so that everything is possible , you don &apos;t have fre@@ e@@ do@@ m . You have par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is .
If you sh@@ at@@ ter this f@@ is@@ h@@ bo@@ w@@ l so that everything is possible , you de@@ cre@@ ase sa@@ ti@@ s@@ fac@@ tion .
You incre@@ ase par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is , and you de@@ cre@@ ase sa@@ ti@@ s@@ fac@@ tion .
E@@ very@@ body nee@@ ds a f@@ is@@ h@@ bo@@ w@@ l .
This one is al@@ most cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly too li@@ mit@@ ed -- per@@ h@@ ap@@ s even for the f@@ ish , cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly for us .
But the ab@@ s@@ ence of some m@@ et@@ ap@@ h@@ or@@ ic@@ al f@@ is@@ h@@ bo@@ w@@ l is a re@@ ci@@ p@@ e for mis@@ er@@ y , and , I s@@ us@@ p@@ ect , dis@@ a@@ ster .
Thank you very much .
