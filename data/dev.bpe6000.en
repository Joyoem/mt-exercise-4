L@@ ast year I showed these two sli@@ des so that demon@@ stra@@ te that the ar@@ c@@ tic ice ca@@ p , which for most of the last three million years has been the size of the lower 4@@ 8 st@@ ates , has s@@ hr@@ un@@ k by 40 percent .
But this under@@ st@@ ates the seri@@ ous@@ ness of this particular problem because it doesn &apos;t show the thi@@ ck@@ ness of the ice .
The ar@@ c@@ tic ice ca@@ p is , in a sense , the be@@ ating heart of the global climate system .
It exp@@ ands in win@@ ter and con@@ tra@@ c@@ ts in sum@@ mer .
The next sli@@ de I show you will be a rap@@ id fa@@ st@@ -@@ forward of what &apos;s happened over the last 25 years .
The per@@ man@@ ent ice is mar@@ ked in red .
As you see , it exp@@ ands to the dark blue -- that &apos;s the an@@ nu@@ al ice in win@@ ter , and it con@@ tra@@ c@@ ts in sum@@ mer .
The so@@ -@@ called per@@ man@@ ent ice , five years old or ol@@ der , you can see is almost like blood , sp@@ ill@@ ing out of the body here .
In 25 years it &apos;s gone from this , to this .
This is a problem because the war@@ ming he@@ ats up the fro@@ zen ground around the Ar@@ c@@ tic O@@ ce@@ an , where there is a massive amount of fro@@ zen carbon which , when it th@@ a@@ ws , is turned into me@@ th@@ ane by micro@@ bes .
Com@@ par@@ ed to the total amount of global war@@ ming poll@@ ution in the atmosphere , that amount could dou@@ ble if we c@@ ross this ti@@ pp@@ ing point .
Al@@ ready in some sh@@ allow la@@ kes in Al@@ as@@ ka , me@@ th@@ ane is ac@@ tively bu@@ b@@ bl@@ ing up out of the water .
Pro@@ f@@ essor Kat@@ ey Wal@@ ter from the University of Al@@ as@@ ka went out with another team to another sh@@ allow la@@ ke last win@@ ter .
Video : Wh@@ o@@ a ! Al G@@ ore : She &apos;s okay . The question is whether we will be .
And one reason is , this enorm@@ ous he@@ at sin@@ k he@@ ats up Gre@@ en@@ land from the nor@@ th .
This is an an@@ nu@@ al mel@@ ting ri@@ ver .
But the vol@@ um@@ es are much larger than ever .
This is the Kan@@ ger@@ lus@@ su@@ a@@ q Ri@@ ver in sou@@ th@@ w@@ est Gre@@ en@@ land .
If you want to know how sea level ris@@ es from land@@ -@@ b@@ ase ice mel@@ ting this is where it re@@ ach@@ es the sea .
These flo@@ ws are increas@@ ing very rap@@ i@@ dly .
At the other end of the planet , Ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic@@ a the largest mass of ice on the planet .
L@@ ast month scientists re@@ por@@ ted the entire contin@@ ent is now in neg@@ ative ice bal@@ ance .
And w@@ est Ant@@ ar@@ c@@ tic@@ a cro@@ pped up on top some under@@ -@@ sea is@@ l@@ ands , is particularly rap@@ id in its mel@@ ting .
That &apos;s equ@@ al to 20 feet of sea level , as is Gre@@ en@@ land .
In the H@@ im@@ ala@@ y@@ as , the third largest mass of ice : at the top you see new la@@ kes , which a few years ago were gl@@ aci@@ ers .
40 percent of all the people in the world get half of their dr@@ in@@ king water from that mel@@ ting f@@ low .
In the An@@ des , this gl@@ ac@@ ier is the source of dr@@ in@@ king water for this city .
The flo@@ ws have increas@@ ed .
But when they go away , so does much of the dr@@ in@@ king water .
In C@@ aliforni@@ a there has been a 40 percent de@@ cl@@ ine in the Si@@ err@@ a s@@ no@@ w@@ p@@ ack .
This is h@@ it@@ ting the res@@ er@@ vo@@ ir@@ s .
And the predic@@ tions , as you &apos;ve read , are serious .
This dr@@ ying around the world has lead to a drama@@ tic incre@@ ase in fir@@ es .
And the dis@@ ast@@ ers around the world have been increas@@ ing at an absolutely extraordinary and un@@ pre@@ ce@@ d@@ ented rate .
F@@ our times as many in the last 30 years as in the pre@@ vi@@ ous 7@@ 5 .
This is a completely un@@ sustain@@ able pattern .
If you look at in the context of history you can see what this is doing .
In the last five years we &apos;ve ad@@ ded 70 million t@@ ons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million t@@ ons every day to the oce@@ ans .
Look car@@ efully at the area of the e@@ ast@@ ern P@@ aci@@ fic , from the Americ@@ as , ex@@ ten@@ ding w@@ est@@ ward , and on either side of the Indi@@ an sub@@ contin@@ ent , where there is a radi@@ cal de@@ ple@@ tion of oxy@@ gen in the oce@@ ans .
The biggest single cause of global war@@ ming , along with de@@ for@@ es@@ tation , which is 20 percent of it , is the bur@@ ning of f@@ os@@ si@@ l fu@@ els .
O@@ il is a problem , and co@@ al is the most serious problem .
The United States is one of the two largest em@@ it@@ ters , along with China .
And the pro@@ pos@@ al has been to build a lot more co@@ al plants .
But we &apos;re beginning to see a sea change .
Here are the ones that have been can@@ c@@ ell@@ ed in the last few years with some green altern@@ ati@@ ves pro@@ pos@@ ed .
Ho@@ we@@ ver there is a political b@@ att@@ le in our country .
And the co@@ al industri@@ es and the oil industri@@ es spent a quar@@ ter of a billion dollars in the last cal@@ end@@ ar year pro@@ mot@@ ing cle@@ an co@@ al , which is an oxy@@ mor@@ on .
That image re@@ min@@ ded me of something .
A@@ ro@@ und Chr@@ ist@@ m@@ as , in my home in T@@ enn@@ es@@ see , a billion g@@ all@@ ons of co@@ al s@@ lu@@ dge was sp@@ ill@@ ed .
You probably saw it on the news .
This , all over the country , is the second largest wa@@ ste stre@@ am in America .
This happened around Chr@@ ist@@ m@@ as .
One of the co@@ al industry &apos;s ads around Chr@@ ist@@ m@@ as was this one .
Video : ♪ ♫ F@@ ros@@ ty the co@@ al man is a j@@ ol@@ ly , happy sou@@ l .
He &apos;s ab@@ und@@ ant here in America , and he hel@@ ps our economy grow .
F@@ ros@@ ty the co@@ al man is getting cle@@ an@@ er every@@ day .
He &apos;s aff@@ ord@@ able and ad@@ or@@ able , and wor@@ kers keep their pay .
Al G@@ ore : This is the source of much of the co@@ al in West Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a .

Video : Don B@@ lan@@ ken@@ ship : Let me be clear about it . Al G@@ ore , N@@ an@@ cy P@@ el@@ os@@ i , Har@@ ry Rei@@ d , they don &apos;t know what they &apos;re talking about .
Al G@@ ore : So the Al@@ li@@ ance for C@@ li@@ mate Prot@@ ection has la@@ un@@ ched two cam@@ pa@@ ig@@ ns .
This is one of them , part of one of them .
Video : Ac@@ tor : At CO@@ A@@ L@@ erg@@ y we view climate change as a very serious thre@@ at to our business .
That &apos;s why we &apos;ve made it our pri@@ mar@@ y goal to spend a large s@@ um of money on an ad@@ ver@@ ti@@ sing eff@@ ort to help bring out and complic@@ ate the truth about co@@ al .
The fact is , co@@ al isn &apos;t di@@ r@@ ty .
We think it &apos;s cle@@ an -- sm@@ ells good , too .
So don &apos;t wor@@ ry about climate change .
Le@@ a@@ ve that up to us .

A@@ ma@@ zing ! The mach@@ in@@ er@@ y is kind of l@@ oud .
But that &apos;s the sound of cle@@ an co@@ al technology .
And while bur@@ ning co@@ al is one of the le@@ ading caus@@ es of global war@@ ming , the remark@@ able cle@@ an co@@ al technology you see here changes everything .
Ta@@ ke a good long look : this is today &apos;s cle@@ an co@@ al technology .
Al G@@ ore : Fin@@ ally , the positive altern@@ ative mes@@ h@@ es with our economic challenge and our national sec@@ urity challenge .

Thank you very much .
L@@ ast year at TED I gave an intro@@ duc@@ tion to the L@@ H@@ C .
And I promis@@ ed to come back and give you an up@@ da@@ te on how that machine worked .
So this is it . And for those of you that weren &apos;t there , the L@@ H@@ C is the largest scientific experiment ever att@@ emp@@ ted -- 2@@ 7 kil@@ ome@@ ters in cir@@ c@@ um@@ ference .
I@@ ts job is to re@@ create the condi@@ tions that were present less than a billi@@ on@@ th of a second after the universe began , up to 600 million times a second .
It &apos;s nothing if not am@@ bi@@ ti@@ ous .
This is the machine bel@@ ow Gen@@ ev@@ a .
We take the pictures of those min@@ i@@ -@@ Bi@@ g Ban@@ gs inside det@@ ec@@ tors .
This is the one I work on . It &apos;s called the A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S det@@ ec@@ tor -- 4@@ 4 me@@ ters wi@@ de , 2@@ 2 me@@ ters in di@@ am@@ eter .
Sp@@ ec@@ t@@ ac@@ ular picture here of A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S under construc@@ tion so you can see the scale .
On the 10@@ th of S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber last year we turned the machine on for the first time .
And this picture was taken by A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S .
It caus@@ ed im@@ men@@ se c@@ ele@@ bra@@ tion in the control room .
It &apos;s a picture of the first be@@ am partic@@ le going all the way around the L@@ H@@ C , col@@ li@@ ding with a piece of the L@@ H@@ C deli@@ ber@@ ately , and sho@@ wer@@ ing partic@@ les into the det@@ ec@@ tor .
In other words , when we saw that picture on S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber 10@@ th we knew the machine worked , which is a great tri@@ ump@@ h .
I don &apos;t know whether this got the biggest che@@ er , or this , when someone went onto Google and saw the front page was like that .
It means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact .
Ab@@ out a week later we had a problem with the machine , rel@@ ated actually to these b@@ its of wi@@ re here -- these g@@ old wir@@ es .
Those wir@@ es car@@ ry 13 thousand am@@ ps when the machine is working in full power .
Now the engine@@ ers am@@ on@@ gst you will look at them and say , &quot; No they don &apos;t . They &apos;re small wir@@ es . &quot;
They can do that because when they are very c@@ old they are what &apos;s called super@@ con@@ duc@@ ting wi@@ re .
So at min@@ us 2@@ 7@@ 1 degre@@ es , col@@ der than the space between the stars , those wir@@ es can take that curr@@ ent .
In one of the jo@@ in@@ ts between over 9@@ ,000 mag@@ n@@ ets in L@@ H@@ C , there was a man@@ u@@ fac@@ tur@@ ing def@@ ect .
So the wi@@ re he@@ ated up sli@@ gh@@ tly , and its 1@@ 3@@ ,000 am@@ ps sud@@ denly en@@ co@@ unter@@ ed electri@@ cal res@@ ist@@ ance .
This was the result .
Now that &apos;s more im@@ pres@@ sive when you consi@@ der those mag@@ n@@ ets wei@@ gh over 20 t@@ ons , and they moved about a foot .
So we da@@ ma@@ ged about 50 of the mag@@ n@@ ets .
We had to take them out , which we did .
We re@@ condi@@ tion@@ ed them all , fi@@ x@@ ed them .
They &apos;re all on their way back under@@ ground now .
By the end of Mar@@ ch the L@@ H@@ C will be in@@ t@@ act again .
We will s@@ wit@@ ch it on , and we expect to take data in J@@ une or Ju@@ ly , and continue with our qu@@ est to find out what the building blo@@ cks of the universe are .
Now of course , in a way those ac@@ ci@@ dents rei@@ g@@ ni@@ te the de@@ b@@ ate about the value of science and engine@@ ering at the e@@ dge . It &apos;s easy to re@@ fu@@ te .
I think that the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact that we &apos;re over@@ re@@ ach@@ ing , is the value of things like the L@@ H@@ C .
I will leave the fin@@ al word to an English scienti@@ st , Hum@@ ph@@ re@@ y D@@ av@@ y , who , I sus@@ pect , when def@@ ending his prot@@ e@@ ge &apos;s us@@ eless experim@@ ents -- his prot@@ e@@ ge was Mi@@ cha@@ el Far@@ ad@@ ay -- said this , &quot; No@@ thing is so danger@@ ous to the pro@@ gress of the human mind than to as@@ su@@ me that our vie@@ ws of science are ulti@@ mate , that there are no my@@ st@@ eri@@ es in nature , that our tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s are comple@@ te , and that there are no new wor@@ l@@ ds to con@@ qu@@ er . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid , playing with blo@@ cks .
As you fig@@ ured out how to reach out and gr@@ as@@ p , pick them up and move them around , you were actually learning how to think and solve problems by understanding and mani@@ pul@@ ating sp@@ ati@@ al relation@@ ships .
S@@ pati@@ al reas@@ on@@ ing is deep@@ ly connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , as a computer scienti@@ st inspi@@ red by this u@@ ti@@ li@@ ty of our inter@@ ac@@ tions with physical objects -- along with my ad@@ vis@@ er P@@ att@@ ie , and my coll@@ abor@@ ator Je@@ ev@@ an Kal@@ ani@@ th@@ i -- I started to w@@ on@@ der -- what if when we used a computer , instead of having this one m@@ ouse cur@@ s@@ or that was a like a digital f@@ ing@@ er@@ ti@@ p moving around a fl@@ at des@@ k@@ top , what if we could reach in with both hands and gr@@ as@@ p information physi@@ cally ,
ar@@ ran@@ ging it the way we wanted ?
This question was so comp@@ ell@@ ing that we decided to expl@@ ore the answer , by building Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les .
In a n@@ ut@@ sh@@ ell , a Si@@ ft@@ able is an inter@@ active computer the size of a co@@ ok@@ ie .
They &apos;re able to be moved around by hand , they can sense each other , they can sense their mo@@ tion , and they have a screen and a wir@@ eless radi@@ o .
Most import@@ antly , they &apos;re physical , so like the blo@@ cks , you can move them just by re@@ ach@@ ing out and gr@@ as@@ p@@ ing .
And Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les are an example of a new ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem of tools for mani@@ pul@@ ating digital information .
And as these tools become more physical , more a@@ ware of their mo@@ tion , a@@ ware of each other , and a@@ ware of the nu@@ ance of how we move them , we can start to expl@@ ore some new and fun inter@@ action st@@ y@@ les .
So , I &apos;m going to start with some simple examples .
This Si@@ ft@@ able is con@@ fig@@ ured to show video , and if I ti@@ lt it in one direc@@ tion , it &apos;ll ro@@ ll the video this way ; if I ti@@ lt it the other way it ro@@ ll@@ s it back@@ wards .
And these inter@@ active por@@ tra@@ its are a@@ ware of each other .
So if I put them next to each other , they get interested .
If they get sur@@ ro@@ und@@ ed , they notice that too , they might get a little flu@@ ster@@ ed .
And they can also sense their mo@@ tion and ti@@ lt .
One of the interesting imp@@ lic@@ ations on inter@@ action , we started to realize , was that we could use every@@ day ges@@ tures on data , like p@@ our@@ ing a color the way we might p@@ our a li@@ qu@@ id .
So in this case , we &apos;ve got three Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les con@@ fig@@ ured to be pa@@ int bu@@ ck@@ ets and I can use them to p@@ our color into that cent@@ ral one , where they get mi@@ x@@ ed .
If we over@@ sh@@ oot , we can p@@ our a little bit back .
There are also some ne@@ at possi@@ bili@@ ties for education , like language , mat@@ h and lo@@ gic games where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly , and view the res@@ ults immedi@@ ately .
So here I &apos;m -- This is a Fi@@ b@@ on@@ acc@@ i sequ@@ ence that I &apos;m making with a simple equ@@ ation program .
Here we have a word game that &apos;s kind of like a m@@ ash@@ -@@ up between S@@ cr@@ ab@@ ble and B@@ og@@ g@@ le .
Bas@@ ically , in every ro@@ und you get a r@@ and@@ om@@ ly assi@@ g@@ ned let@@ ter on each Si@@ ft@@ able , and as you try to make words it ch@@ ec@@ ks against a dic@@ tion@@ ary .
Then , after about 30 secon@@ ds , it res@@ hu@@ ff@@ les , and you have a new set of let@@ ters and new possi@@ bili@@ ties to try .
Thank you .
So these are some kids that came on a field tri@@ p to the Medi@@ a L@@ ab , and I man@@ aged to get them to try it out , and sh@@ oot a video .
They really lo@@ ved it .
And , one of the interesting things about this kind of app@@ lic@@ ation is that you don &apos;t have to give people many in@@ struc@@ tions .
All you have to say is , &quot; Ma@@ ke words , &quot; and they know exactly what to do .
So here &apos;s another few people trying it out .
That &apos;s our y@@ oun@@ gest bet@@ a tes@@ ter , down there on the right .
Tur@@ ns out , all he wanted to do was to st@@ ack the Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les up .
So to him , they were just blo@@ cks .
Now , this is an inter@@ active car@@ to@@ on app@@ lic@@ ation .
And we wanted to build a learning to@@ ol for language lear@@ ners .
And this is F@@ eli@@ x , actually .
And he can bring new charac@@ ters into the sc@@ ene , just by li@@ f@@ ting the Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les off the table that have that charac@@ ter sho@@ wn on them .
Here , he &apos;s br@@ ing@@ ing the sun out .
David M@@ er@@ ri@@ ll : Now he &apos;s brought a tra@@ c@@ tor into the sc@@ ene .
Go@@ od job ! Yeah !
D@@ M : So by sha@@ king the Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les and putting them next to each other he can make the charac@@ ters inter@@ act -- Video : Wo@@ of !
D@@ M : inv@@ ent@@ ing his own nar@@ ra@@ tive .
D@@ M : It &apos;s an op@@ en-@@ ended story , and he gets to deci@@ de how it un@@ fol@@ ds .
D@@ M : So , the last example I have time to show you today is a music sequ@@ en@@ cing and live per@@ forman@@ ce to@@ ol that we &apos;ve built recently , in which Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les act as so@@ unds like lead , b@@ ass and dr@@ ums .
E@@ ach of these has four different vari@@ ations , you get to cho@@ ose which one you want to use .
And you can in@@ ject these so@@ unds into a sequ@@ ence that you can ass@@ em@@ ble into the pattern that you want .
And you in@@ ject it by just b@@ ump@@ ing up the sound Si@@ ft@@ able against a sequ@@ ence Si@@ ft@@ able .
There are eff@@ ects that you can control live , like re@@ ver@@ b and fil@@ ter .
You at@@ ta@@ ch it to a particular sound and then ti@@ lt to ad@@ just it .
And then , over@@ all eff@@ ects like tem@@ p@@ o and vol@@ u@@ me that app@@ ly to the entire sequ@@ ence .
So let &apos;s have a look .
Video : D@@ M : We &apos;ll start by putting a lead into two sequ@@ ence Si@@ ft@@ ab@@ les , ar@@ range them into a series , ex@@ tend it , add a little more lead .
Now I put a b@@ ass line in .
Video : D@@ M : Now I &apos;ll put some perc@@ us@@ sion in .
Video : D@@ M : And now I &apos;ll at@@ ta@@ ch the fil@@ ter to the dr@@ ums , so I can control the effect live .
Video : D@@ M : I can speed up the whole sequ@@ ence by ti@@ l@@ ting the tem@@ p@@ o one way or the other .
Video : D@@ M : And now I &apos;ll at@@ ta@@ ch the fil@@ ter to the b@@ ass for some more ex@@ pression .
Video : D@@ M : I can re@@ ar@@ range the sequ@@ ence while it pla@@ ys .
So I don &apos;t have to plan it out in ad@@ v@@ ance , but I can impro@@ vis@@ e , making it longer or sh@@ or@@ ter as I go .
And now , finally , I can fa@@ de the whole sequ@@ ence out using the vol@@ u@@ me Si@@ ft@@ able , ti@@ l@@ ted to the left .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passi@@ on is for making new human@@ -@@ computer inter@@ fac@@ es that are a better mat@@ ch to the ways our bra@@ ins and bo@@ dies work .
And today , I had time to show you one point in this new design space , and a few of the possi@@ bili@@ ties that we &apos;re working to bring out of the lab@@ or@@ at@@ ory .
So the thought I want to leave you with is that we &apos;re on the c@@ us@@ p of this new generation of tools for inter@@ ac@@ ting with digital media that are going to bring information into our world on our terms .
Thank you very much .
I look forward to talking with all of you .
I am a wri@@ ter .
W@@ ri@@ ting books is my profes@@ sion but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It is also my great li@@ fel@@ ong love and fas@@ cin@@ ation .
And I don &apos;t expect that that &apos;s ever going to change .
But , that said , something kind of pec@@ u@@ li@@ ar has happened recently in my life and in my car@@ e@@ er , which has caus@@ ed me to have to rec@@ ali@@ bra@@ te my whole relationship with this work .
And the pec@@ u@@ li@@ ar thing is that I recently wrote this book , this mem@@ o@@ ir called &quot; E@@ at , P@@ ra@@ y , Lo@@ ve &quot; which , deci@@ de@@ dly un@@ like any of my pre@@ vi@@ ous books , went out in the world for some reason , and became this big , me@@ ga@@ -@@ sen@@ sation , inter@@ national bes@@ ts@@ eller thing .
The result of which is that everywhere I go now , people tre@@ at me like I &apos;m do@@ om@@ ed .
S@@ eri@@ ously -- do@@ om@@ ed , do@@ om@@ ed !
Like , they come up to me now , all wor@@ ried , and they say , &quot; Ar@@ en &apos;t you a@@ fra@@ id you &apos;re never going to be able to top that ?
Ar@@ en &apos;t you a@@ fra@@ id you &apos;re going to keep writing for your whole life and you &apos;re never again going to create a book that anybody in the world car@@ es about at all , ever again ? &quot;
So that &apos;s re@@ ass@@ ur@@ ing , you know .
But it would be wor@@ se , except for that I happen to remember that over 20 years ago , when I was a te@@ en@@ ager , when I first started telling people that I wanted to be a wri@@ ter , I was met with this same sort of f@@ ear@@ -@@ based re@@ action .
And people would say , &quot; Ar@@ en &apos;t you a@@ fra@@ id you &apos;re never going to have any success ?
Ar@@ en &apos;t you a@@ fra@@ id the hum@@ ili@@ ation of re@@ j@@ ection will k@@ ill you ?
Ar@@ en &apos;t you a@@ fra@@ id that you &apos;re going to work your whole life at this cra@@ ft and nothing &apos;s ever going to come of it and you &apos;re going to die on a sc@@ ra@@ p he@@ ap of bro@@ ken dre@@ ams with your m@@ outh f@@ ill@@ ed with bit@@ ter ash of fail@@ ure ? &quot;
Like that , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all those questions is , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Yes , I &apos;m a@@ fra@@ id of all those things .
And I always have been .
And I &apos;m a@@ fra@@ id of many , many more things bes@@ i@@ des that people can &apos;t even guess at , like se@@ a@@ we@@ ed and other things that are sc@@ ary .
But , when it comes to writing , the thing that I &apos;ve been sort of thinking about l@@ ately , and wonder@@ ing about l@@ ately , is why ?
You know , is it ra@@ tional ?
Is it lo@@ gi@@ cal that anybody should be exp@@ ected to be a@@ fra@@ id of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do .
And what is it speci@@ f@@ ically about creative vent@@ ures that seems to make us really ner@@ v@@ ous about each other &apos;s mental health in a way that other car@@ e@@ ers kind of don &apos;t do , you know ?
Like my da@@ d , for example , was a chem@@ ical engine@@ er and I don &apos;t rec@@ all once in his 40 years of chem@@ ical engine@@ ering anybody asking him if he was a@@ fra@@ id to be a chem@@ ical engine@@ er , you know ?
&quot; That chem@@ ic@@ al@@ -@@ engine@@ ering blo@@ ck , John , how &apos;s it going ? &quot;
It just didn &apos;t come up like that , you know ?
But to be fa@@ ir , chem@@ ical engine@@ ers as a group haven &apos;t really ear@@ ned a rep@@ ut@@ ation over the cent@@ uri@@ es for being al@@ co@@ ho@@ li@@ c man@@ ic@@ -@@ de@@ pres@@ si@@ ves .
We wri@@ ters , we kind of do have that rep@@ ut@@ ation , and not just wri@@ ters , but creative people across all gen@@ r@@ es , it seems , have this rep@@ ut@@ ation for being enorm@@ ously ment@@ ally un@@ st@@ able .
And all you have to do is look at the very gri@@ m death coun@@ t in the 20@@ th century alone , of really mag@@ ni@@ fic@@ ent creative minds who died young and often at their own hands , you know ?
And even the ones who didn &apos;t literally com@@ mit su@@ ici@@ de seem to be really und@@ one by their gi@@ f@@ ts , you know .
Nor@@ man Ma@@ il@@ er , just before he died , last inter@@ view , he said , &quot; Every one of my books has kill@@ ed me a little more . &quot;
An extraordinary stat@@ ement to make about your life &apos;s work .
But we don &apos;t even b@@ lin@@ k when we hear somebody say this , because we &apos;ve heard that kind of stuff for so long and somehow we &apos;ve completely inter@@ n@@ alized and acc@@ ep@@ ted collec@@ tively this no@@ tion that cre@@ ativity and suff@@ ering are somehow in@@ her@@ ently lin@@ ked and that arti@@ str@@ y , in the end , will always ulti@@ mat@@ ely lead to an@@ gu@@ ish .
And the question that I want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that idea ?
A@@ re you com@@ fort@@ able with that ?
Because you look at it even from an in@@ ch away and , you know -- I &apos;m not at all com@@ fort@@ able with that as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion .
I think it &apos;s o@@ di@@ ous .
And I also think it &apos;s danger@@ ous , and I don &apos;t want to see it per@@ p@@ et@@ u@@ ated into the next century .
I think it &apos;s better if we en@@ coura@@ ge our great creative minds to live .
And I defin@@ it@@ ely know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very danger@@ ous for me to start sort of lea@@ king down that dark pat@@ h of as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion , particularly given the cir@@ c@@ um@@ st@@ ance that I &apos;m in right now in my car@@ e@@ er .
Which is -- you know , like ch@@ eck it out , I &apos;m pretty young , I &apos;m only about 40 years old .
I still have maybe another four dec@@ a@@ des of work left in me .
And it &apos;s ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ ingly likely that anything I write from this point forward is going to be ju@@ d@@ ged by the world as the work that came after the fre@@ ak@@ ish success of my last book , right ?
I should just put it bl@@ un@@ tly , because we &apos;re all sort of friends here now -- it &apos;s ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ ingly likely that my great@@ est success is behind me .
So J@@ es@@ us , what a thought !
That &apos;s the kind of thought that could lead a person to start dr@@ in@@ king g@@ in at nine o &apos;@@ clo@@ ck in the morning , and I don &apos;t want to go there .
I would pre@@ fer to keep doing this work that I love .
And so , the question becomes , how ?
And so , it seems to me , up@@ on a lot of ref@@ lec@@ tion , that the way that I have to work now , in order to continue writing , is that I have to create some sort of prot@@ ec@@ tive psych@@ ological construc@@ t , right ?
I have to sort of find some way to have a safe dist@@ ance between me , as I am writing , and my very natural an@@ xi@@ ety about what the re@@ action to that writing is going to be , from now on .
And , as I &apos;ve been looking , over the last year , for models for how to do that , I &apos;ve been sort of looking across time , and I &apos;ve been trying to find other soci@@ e@@ ties to see if they might have had better and s@@ an@@ er ideas than we have about how to help creative people sort of man@@ age the in@@ her@@ ent emo@@ tional ris@@ ks of cre@@ ativity .
And that sear@@ ch has led me to an@@ ci@@ ent Gre@@ ec@@ e and an@@ ci@@ ent R@@ ome .
So stay with me , because it does cir@@ cle around and back .
But , an@@ ci@@ ent Gre@@ ec@@ e and an@@ ci@@ ent R@@ ome -- people did not happen to believe that cre@@ ativity came from human beings back then , OK ?
People be@@ liev@@ ed that cre@@ ativity was this di@@ v@@ ine atten@@ d@@ ant spir@@ it that came to human beings from some dist@@ ant and unk@@ no@@ w@@ able source , for dist@@ ant and unk@@ no@@ w@@ able reasons .
The Gre@@ e@@ ks fam@@ ously called these di@@ v@@ ine atten@@ d@@ ant spi@@ ri@@ ts of cre@@ ativity &quot; da@@ em@@ ons . &quot;
So@@ cr@@ ates , fam@@ ously , be@@ liev@@ ed that he had a da@@ em@@ on who spo@@ ke wis@@ dom to him from af@@ ar .
The R@@ om@@ ans had the same idea , but they called that sort of dis@@ em@@ bo@@ died creative spir@@ it a geni@@ us .
Which is great , because the R@@ om@@ ans did not actually think that a geni@@ us was a particularly cle@@ ver individual .
They be@@ liev@@ ed that a geni@@ us was this , sort of ma@@ gi@@ cal di@@ v@@ ine enti@@ ty , who was be@@ liev@@ ed to literally live in the w@@ alls of an arti@@ st &apos;s studi@@ o , kind of like D@@ ob@@ by the house el@@ f , and sort of inv@@ isi@@ bly ass@@ ist the arti@@ st with their work and would shape the out@@ come of that work .
So bri@@ lli@@ ant -- there it is , right there , that dist@@ ance that I &apos;m talking about -- that psych@@ ological construc@@ t to prot@@ ect you from the res@@ ults of your work .
And everyone knew that this is how it fun@@ c@@ tion@@ ed , right ?
So the an@@ ci@@ ent arti@@ st was prot@@ ected from certain things , like , for example , too much nar@@ cis@@ s@@ ism , right ?
If your work was bri@@ lli@@ ant , you couldn &apos;t take all the cre@@ d@@ it for it , everybody knew that you had this dis@@ em@@ bo@@ died geni@@ us who had help@@ ed you .
If your work bom@@ bed , not enti@@ r@@ ely your f@@ au@@ lt , you know ?
Every@@ one knew your geni@@ us was kind of l@@ ame .
And this is how people thought about cre@@ ativity in the West for a really long time .
And then the R@@ en@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance came and everything changed , and we had this big idea , and the big idea was , let &apos;s put the individual human being at the center of the universe above all go@@ ds and my@@ st@@ eri@@ es , and there &apos;s no more room for my@@ sti@@ cal cre@@ atures who take dic@@ tation from the di@@ v@@ ine .
And it &apos;s the beginning of ra@@ tional human@@ ism , and people started to believe that cre@@ ativity came completely from the self of the individual .
And for the first time in history , you start to hear people re@@ fer@@ r@@ ing to this or that arti@@ st as being a geni@@ us , rather than having a geni@@ us .
And I got to tell you , I think that was a huge er@@ ror .
You know , I think that allo@@ wing somebody , one m@@ ere person to believe that he or she is like , the v@@ es@@ sel , you know , like the f@@ on@@ t and the ess@@ ence and the source of all di@@ v@@ ine , creative , unk@@ no@@ w@@ able , e@@ tern@@ al my@@ ster@@ y is just a s@@ mi@@ dge too much responsi@@ bility to put on one fra@@ gi@@ le , human p@@ sy@@ che .
It &apos;s like asking somebody to s@@ wal@@ low the sun .
It just completely war@@ ps and dis@@ tor@@ ts e@@ go@@ s , and it cre@@ ates all these un@@ man@@ a@@ ge@@ able exp@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions about per@@ forman@@ ce .
And I think the pres@@ sure of that has been kill@@ ing off our arti@@ sts for the last 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it is true , the question becomes , what now ?
Can we do this differ@@ ently ?
Maybe go back to some more an@@ ci@@ ent understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative my@@ ster@@ y .
Maybe not .
Maybe we can &apos;t just er@@ ase 500 years of ra@@ tional human@@ is@@ tic thought in one 18 minute spe@@ e@@ ch .
And there &apos;s probably people in this audience who would ra@@ ise really le@@ gi@@ ti@@ mate scientific sus@@ pic@@ i@@ ons about the no@@ tion of , basically , fa@@ i@@ ries who follow people around ru@@ b@@ bing fa@@ ir@@ y ju@@ ice on their projects and stuff .
I &apos;m not , probably , going to bring you all along with me on this .
But the question that I kind of want to pose is -- you know , why not ?
Why not think about it this way ?
Because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard in terms of expla@@ ining the utter ma@@ d@@ den@@ ing cap@@ ri@@ ci@@ ous@@ ness of the creative process .
A process which , as anybody who has ever tried to make something -- which is to say basically everyone here -@@ -- knows does not always beh@@ a@@ ve ra@@ tion@@ ally .
And , in fact , can sometimes feel do@@ wn@@ right par@@ an@@ or@@ mal .
I had this en@@ coun@@ ter recently where I met the extraordinary American po@@ et Ru@@ th St@@ one , who &apos;s now in her 9@@ 0s , but she &apos;s been a po@@ et her entire life and she told me that when she was growing up in r@@ ural Vir@@ g@@ ini@@ a , she would be out working in the fi@@ el@@ ds , and she said she would feel and hear a po@@ em coming at her from over the land@@ sc@@ ape .
And she said it was like a th@@ under@@ ous tra@@ in of air .
And it would come bar@@ rel@@ ing down at her over the land@@ sc@@ ape .
And she felt it coming , because it would sha@@ ke the earth under her feet .
She knew that she had only one thing to do at that point , and that was to , in her words , &quot; run like h@@ ell . &quot;
And she would run like h@@ ell to the house and she would be getting ch@@ as@@ ed by this po@@ em , and the whole deal was that she had to get to a piece of paper and a pen@@ ci@@ l fast enough so that when it th@@ under@@ ed through her , she could collec@@ t it and gra@@ b it on the page .
And other times she wouldn &apos;t be fast enough , so she &apos;d be running and running , and she wouldn &apos;t get to the house and the po@@ em would bar@@ re@@ l through her and she would mis@@ s it and she said it would continue on across the land@@ sc@@ ape , looking , as she put it &quot; for another po@@ et . &quot;
And then there were these times -- this is the piece I never for@@ got -- she said that there were mom@@ ents where she would almost mis@@ s it , right ?
So , she &apos;s running to the house and she &apos;s looking for the paper and the po@@ em pass@@ es through her , and she gr@@ ab@@ s a pen@@ ci@@ l just as it &apos;s going through her , and then she said , it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would cat@@ ch it .
She would cat@@ ch the po@@ em by its tail , and she would p@@ ull it back@@ wards into her body as she was tran@@ scri@@ bing on the page .
And in these inst@@ an@@ ces , the po@@ em would come up on the page perfect and in@@ t@@ act but back@@ wards , from the last word to the first .
So when I heard that I was like -- that &apos;s un@@ can@@ ny , that &apos;s exactly what my creative process is like .
That &apos;s not at all what my creative process is -- I &apos;m not the pi@@ p@@ el@@ ine !
I &apos;m a m@@ ule , and the way that I have to work is I have to get up at the same time every day , and swe@@ at and lab@@ or and bar@@ re@@ l through it really aw@@ k@@ war@@ dly .
But even I , in my mu@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , even I have br@@ ush@@ ed up against that thing , at times .
And I would imagine that a lot of you have too .
You know , even I have had work or ideas come through me from a source that I hon@@ est@@ ly cannot identi@@ fy .
And what is that thing ?
And how are we to rel@@ ate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds , but , in fact , might actually keep us s@@ ane ?
And for me , the best con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary example that I have of how to do that is the mus@@ ici@@ an T@@ om W@@ a@@ its , who I got to inter@@ view several years ago on a ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine assi@@ gn@@ ment .
And we were talking about this , and you know , T@@ om , for most of his life , he was pretty much the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of the tor@@ ment@@ ed con@@ tem@@ por@@ ary modern arti@@ st , trying to control and man@@ age and dom@@ in@@ ate these sort of un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able creative imp@@ ul@@ ses that were totally inter@@ n@@ alized .
But then he got ol@@ der , he got cal@@ mer , and one day he was dri@@ ving down the free@@ way in L@@ os An@@ gel@@ es , and this is when it all changed for him .
And he &apos;s spe@@ e@@ ding along , and all of a sud@@ den he hear@@ s this little fra@@ g@@ ment of mel@@ o@@ dy , that comes into his head as inspi@@ ration often comes , el@@ usi@@ ve and tan@@ tal@@ i@@ zing , and he wants it , it &apos;s g@@ or@@ ge@@ ous , and he lon@@ gs for it , but he has no way to get it .
He doesn &apos;t have a piece of paper , or a pen@@ ci@@ l , or a t@@ ape rec@@ order .
So he starts to feel all of that old an@@ xi@@ ety start to rise in him like , &quot; I &apos;m going to lose this thing , and I &apos;ll be be ha@@ un@@ ted by this song for@@ ever .
I &apos;m not good enough , and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And instead of p@@ ani@@ cking , he just stopp@@ ed .
He just stopp@@ ed that whole mental process and he did something completely nov@@ el .
He just looked up at the sky , and he said , &quot; Ex@@ c@@ use me , can you not see that I &apos;m dri@@ ving ? &quot;
&quot; Do I look like I can write down a song right now ?
If you really want to ex@@ ist , come back at a more opport@@ une moment when I can take care of you .
O@@ ther@@ wise , go bo@@ ther somebody else today .
G@@ o bo@@ ther Le@@ on@@ ard C@@ oh@@ en . &quot;
And his whole work process changed after that .
Not the work , the work was still o@@ f@@ ten@@ times as dark as ever .
But the process , and the he@@ av@@ y an@@ xi@@ ety around it was rel@@ eas@@ ed when he took the gen@@ ie , the geni@@ us out of him where it was caus@@ ing nothing but trou@@ ble , and rel@@ eas@@ ed it back where it came from , and realized that this didn &apos;t have to be this inter@@ n@@ alized , tor@@ ment@@ ed thing .
It could be this pec@@ u@@ li@@ ar , w@@ on@@ dr@@ ous , bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re coll@@ abor@@ ation , kind of conver@@ sation between T@@ om and the st@@ range , ex@@ tern@@ al thing that was not quite T@@ om .
When I heard that story , it started to shi@@ ft a little bit the way that I worked too , and this idea already sa@@ ved me once .
It sa@@ ved me when I was in the middle of writing &quot; E@@ at , P@@ ra@@ y , Lo@@ ve , &quot; and I f@@ ell into one of those sort of p@@ its of des@@ pa@@ ir that we all fall into when we &apos;re working on something and it &apos;s not coming and you start to think this is going to be a dis@@ a@@ ster , the wor@@ st book ever w@@ ritten .
Not just bad , but the wor@@ st book ever w@@ ritten .
And I started to think I should just d@@ ump this project .
But then I remem@@ ber@@ ed T@@ om talking to the open air and I tried it .
So I just li@@ f@@ ted my face up from the man@@ us@@ cri@@ pt and I direc@@ ted my comm@@ ents to an emp@@ ty cor@@ ner of the room .
And I said al@@ oud , &quot; L@@ isten you , thing , you and I both know that if this book isn &apos;t bri@@ lli@@ ant that is not enti@@ r@@ ely my f@@ au@@ lt , right ?
Because you can see that I am putting everything I have into this , I don &apos;t have any more than this .
If you want it to be better , you &apos;ve got to show up and do your part of the deal .
But if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , the h@@ ell with it .
I &apos;m going to keep writing any@@ way because that &apos;s my job .
And I would please like the rec@@ ord to ref@@ lec@@ t today that I showed up for my part of the job . &quot;
Because -- Because in the end it &apos;s like this , OK -- cent@@ uri@@ es ago in the des@@ er@@ ts of North Africa , people used to ga@@ ther for these mo@@ on@@ light dan@@ ces of s@@ ac@@ red dan@@ ce and music that would go on for hours and hours , until da@@ wn .
They were always mag@@ ni@@ fic@@ ent , because the dan@@ c@@ ers were profession@@ als and they were terri@@ fic , right ?
But every once in a while , very r@@ ar@@ ely , something would happen , and one of these per@@ form@@ ers would actually become tran@@ sc@@ end@@ ent .
And I know you know what I &apos;m talking about , because I know you &apos;ve all seen , at some point in your life , a per@@ forman@@ ce like this .
It was like time would stop , and the dan@@ cer would sort of step through some kind of port@@ al and he wasn &apos;t doing anything different than he had ever done , 1@@ ,000 ni@@ ghts before , but everything would al@@ ig@@ n .
And all of a sud@@ den , he would no longer appe@@ ar to be mer@@ ely human .
He would be li@@ t from within , and li@@ t from bel@@ ow and all li@@ t up on fire with di@@ v@@ in@@ ity .
And when this happened , back then , people knew it for what it was , you know , they called it by its name .
They would put their hands together and they would start to ch@@ ant , &quot; Al@@ la@@ h , Al@@ la@@ h , Al@@ la@@ h , God , God , God . &quot;
That &apos;s God , you know .
C@@ uri@@ ous hist@@ or@@ ical fo@@ ot@@ no@@ te : when the Mo@@ ors inv@@ ad@@ ed sou@@ th@@ ern Spa@@ in , they took this cu@@ st@@ om with them and the pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation changed over the cent@@ uri@@ es from &quot; Al@@ la@@ h , Al@@ la@@ h , Al@@ la@@ h , &quot; to &quot; O@@ l@@ é , ol@@ é , ol@@ é , &quot; which you still hear in bul@@ l@@ fi@@ ghts and in fl@@ am@@ en@@ co dan@@ ces .
In Spa@@ in , when a per@@ for@@ mer has done something impossible and ma@@ gic , &quot; Al@@ la@@ h , ol@@ é , ol@@ é , Al@@ la@@ h , mag@@ ni@@ fic@@ ent , bra@@ v@@ o , &quot; in@@ comp@@ re@@ h@@ ensi@@ ble , there it is -- a gli@@ mp@@ se of God .
Which is great , because we need that .
But , the tri@@ cky bit comes the next morning , for the dan@@ cer him@@ self , when he w@@ ak@@ es up and disco@@ vers that it &apos;s Tu@@ es@@ day at 11 a@@ .@@ m@@ . , and he &apos;s no longer a gli@@ mp@@ se of God .
He &apos;s just an aging mor@@ t@@ al with really bad k@@ ne@@ es , and maybe he &apos;s never going to as@@ c@@ end to that hei@@ ght again .
And maybe nobody will ever ch@@ ant God &apos;s name again as he sp@@ ins , and what is he then to do with the rest of his life ?
This is hard .
This is one of the most pain@@ ful re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ations to make in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn &apos;t have to be quite so full of an@@ gu@@ ish if you never happened to believe , in the first place , that the most extraordinary as@@ p@@ ects of your being came from you .
But maybe if you just be@@ liev@@ ed that they were on lo@@ an to you from some uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able source for some ex@@ qu@@ isi@@ te por@@ tion of your life to be pass@@ ed along when you &apos;re fin@@ ished , with somebody else .
And , you know , if we think about it this way , it starts to change everything .
This is how I &apos;ve started to think , and this is certainly how I &apos;ve been thinking in the last few months as I &apos;ve been working on the book that will soon be publi@@ shed , as the danger@@ ously , fri@@ gh@@ ten@@ ingly over@@ -@@ anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ated follow up to my fre@@ ak@@ ish success .
And what I have to sort of keep telling myself when I get really psych@@ ed out about that is don &apos;t be a@@ fra@@ id .
Don &apos;t be da@@ un@@ ted . Just do your job .
Con@@ tin@@ ue to show up for your piece of it , whatever that might be .
If your job is to dan@@ ce , do your dan@@ ce .
If the di@@ v@@ ine , co@@ ck@@ ey@@ ed geni@@ us assi@@ g@@ ned to your case deci@@ des to let some sort of wonder@@ ment be gli@@ mp@@ sed , for just one moment through your eff@@ or@@ ts , then &quot; O@@ l@@ é ! &quot;
And if not , do your dan@@ ce any@@ how .
And &quot; O@@ l@@ é ! &quot; to you , n@@ on@@ eth@@ eless .
I believe this and I feel that we must teach it .
&quot; O@@ l@@ é ! &quot; to you , n@@ on@@ eth@@ eless , just for having the sh@@ e@@ er human love and st@@ ub@@ bor@@ n@@ ness to keep showing up .
Thank you .
Thank you .
J@@ une C@@ oh@@ en : O@@ l@@ é !
You know , I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects before -- about the human gen@@ ome and what that might mean , and disco@@ ver@@ ing new s@@ ets of gen@@ es .
We &apos;re actually starting at a new point : we &apos;ve been di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing biology , and now we &apos;re trying to go from that digital code into a new ph@@ ase of biology with desig@@ ning and syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zing life .
So , we &apos;ve always been trying to ask big questions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; is something that I think many biolog@@ ists have been trying to understand at vari@@ ous le@@ vels .
We &apos;ve tried vari@@ ous appro@@ ach@@ es , par@@ ing it down to min@@ i@@ mal comp@@ on@@ ents .
We &apos;ve been di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing it now for almost 20 years ; when we sequ@@ en@@ ced the human gen@@ ome , it was going from the an@@ al@@ o@@ g world of biology into the digital world of the computer .
Now we &apos;re trying to ask , &quot; Can we re@@ gener@@ ate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe ? &quot;
This is the map of a small organ@@ ism , My@@ cop@@ l@@ as@@ ma gen@@ it@@ ali@@ um , that has the sm@@ all@@ est gen@@ ome for a species that can self-@@ rep@@ lic@@ ate in the lab@@ or@@ at@@ ory , and we &apos;ve been trying to just see if we can come up with an even sm@@ aller gen@@ ome .
We &apos;re able to kno@@ ck out on the order of 100 gen@@ es out of the 500 or so that are here .
When we look at its met@@ abo@@ li@@ c map , it &apos;s rel@@ ativ@@ ely simple compar@@ ed to ours -- tr@@ ust me , this is simple -- but when we look at all the gen@@ es that we can kno@@ ck out one at a time , it &apos;s very un@@ likely that this would y@@ i@@ eld a living cell .
So we decided the only way forward was to actually syn@@ thes@@ i@@ ze this ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome so we could v@@ ary the comp@@ on@@ ents to ask some of these most fundamental questions .
And so we started down the road of : can we syn@@ thes@@ i@@ ze a ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome ?
Can chem@@ is@@ try per@@ mit making these really large molec@@ ules where we &apos;ve never been before ?
And if we do , can we bo@@ ot up a ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome ?
A ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome , by the way , is just a piece of in@@ ert chem@@ ical material .
So , our p@@ ace of di@@ gi@@ ti@@ zing life has been increas@@ ing at an exp@@ on@@ ential p@@ ace .
Our ability to write the gene@@ tic code has been moving pretty s@@ low@@ ly but has been increas@@ ing , and our l@@ at@@ est point would put it on , now , an exp@@ on@@ ential cur@@ ve .
We started this over 15 years ago .
It took several st@@ ages , in fact , starting with a bio@@ eth@@ ical re@@ view before we did the first experim@@ ents .
But it turns out syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zing DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of mach@@ ines around the world that make small pieces of DNA -- 30 to 50 let@@ ters in l@@ eng@@ th -- and it &apos;s a de@@ gener@@ ate process , so the longer you make the piece , the more err@@ ors there are .
So we had to create a new me@@ th@@ od for putting these little pieces together and cor@@ rec@@ t all the err@@ ors .
And this was our first att@@ em@@ pt , starting with the digital information of the gen@@ ome of ph@@ i X@@ 17@@ 4 .
It &apos;s a small virus that kill@@ s bacteria .
We designed the pieces , went through our er@@ ror cor@@ rec@@ tion and had a DNA molec@@ ule of about 5,000 let@@ ters .
The exciting ph@@ ase came when we took this piece of in@@ ert chem@@ ical and put it in the bacteria , and the bacteria started to read this gene@@ tic code , made the vi@@ ral partic@@ les .
The vi@@ ral partic@@ les then were rel@@ eas@@ ed from the cells and came back and kill@@ ed the E@@ . col@@ i .
I was talking to the oil industry recently and I said they clear@@ ly under@@ stood that model .
They lau@@ gh@@ ed more than you guys are . And so , we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own har@@ d@@ ware in a bi@@ ological system .
But we wanted to go much larger : we wanted to build the entire bacteri@@ al ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome -- it &apos;s over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 let@@ ters of gene@@ tic code -- so we thought we &apos;d build them in c@@ ass@@ et@@ tes the size of the vir@@ uses so we could actually v@@ ary the c@@ ass@@ et@@ tes to understand what the ac@@ tual comp@@ on@@ ents of a living cell are .
Design is critical , and if you &apos;re starting with digital information in the computer , that digital information has to be really ac@@ cur@@ ate .
When we first sequ@@ en@@ ced this gen@@ ome in 199@@ 5 , the stand@@ ard of ac@@ cur@@ ac@@ y was one er@@ ror per 10@@ ,000 b@@ ase pa@@ ir@@ s .
We actually found , on res@@ equ@@ en@@ cing it , 30 err@@ ors ; had we used that origin@@ al sequ@@ ence , it never would have been able to be bo@@ ot@@ ed up .
Par@@ t of the design is desig@@ ning pieces that are 50 let@@ ters long that have to over@@ la@@ p with all the other 50@@ -@@ let@@ ter pieces to build sm@@ aller sub@@ un@@ its we have to design so they can go together .
We design uni@@ que el@@ ements into this .
You may have read that we put wat@@ er@@ mar@@ ks in .
Th@@ ink of this : we have a f@@ our@@ -@@ let@@ ter gene@@ tic code -- A , C , G and T .
Tri@@ ple@@ ts of those let@@ ters code for r@@ ough@@ ly 20 am@@ in@@ o aci@@ ds , such that there &apos;s a single let@@ ter desig@@ n@@ ation for each of the am@@ in@@ o aci@@ ds .
So we can use the gene@@ tic code to write out words , s@@ ent@@ ences , thou@@ ghts .
I@@ ni@@ ti@@ ally , all we did was au@@ to@@ grap@@ h it .
Some people were dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted there was not po@@ et@@ ry .
We designed these pieces so we can just che@@ w back with enz@@ ym@@ es ; there are enz@@ ym@@ es that re@@ pa@@ ir them and put them together .
And we started making pieces , starting with pieces that were 5,000 to 7@@ ,000 let@@ ters , put those together to make 2@@ 4@@ ,@@ 00@@ 0-@@ let@@ ter pieces , then put s@@ ets of those going up to 7@@ 2@@ ,000 .
At each stage , we gre@@ w up these pieces in ab@@ und@@ ance so we could sequ@@ ence them because we &apos;re trying to create a process that &apos;s extremely ro@@ b@@ ust that you can see in a minute .
We &apos;re trying to get to the point of autom@@ ation .
So , this looks like a bas@@ k@@ et@@ ball play@@ off .
When we get into these really large pieces over 10@@ 0,000 b@@ ase pa@@ ir@@ s , they won &apos;t any longer grow re@@ a@@ di@@ ly in E@@ . col@@ i -- it ex@@ hau@@ sts all the modern tools of molec@@ ular biology -- and so we turned to other mechan@@ is@@ ms .
We knew there &apos;s a mechan@@ ism called hom@@ olog@@ ous re@@ com@@ bin@@ ation that biology uses to re@@ pa@@ ir DNA that can put pieces together .
Here &apos;s an example of it : there &apos;s an organ@@ ism called D@@ ein@@ o@@ co@@ c@@ c@@ us radi@@ o@@ dur@@ ans that can take three millions ra@@ ds of radi@@ ation .
You can see in the top pan@@ el , its ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome just gets blo@@ wn ap@@ art .
T@@ wel@@ ve to 24 hours later , it put it back together exactly as it was before .
We have thousands of organis@@ ms that can do this .
These organis@@ ms can be totally des@@ ic@@ c@@ ated ; they can live in a v@@ ac@@ u@@ um .
I am absolutely certain that life can ex@@ ist in ou@@ ter space , move around , find a new a@@ qu@@ e@@ ous environment .
In fact , NASA has sho@@ wn a lot of this is out there .
Here &apos;s an ac@@ tual micro@@ grap@@ h of the molec@@ ule we built using these process@@ es , actually just using ye@@ ast mechan@@ is@@ ms with the right design of the pieces we put them in ; ye@@ ast pu@@ ts them together automati@@ cally .
This is not an elec@@ tr@@ on micro@@ grap@@ h ; this is just a reg@@ ular phot@@ om@@ ic@@ ro@@ grap@@ h .
It &apos;s such a large molec@@ ule we can see it with a light mic@@ ros@@ cope .
These are pictures over about a si@@ x@@ -@@ second period .
So , this is the p@@ ub@@ lic@@ ation we had just a short while ago .
This is over 5@@ 8@@ 0,000 let@@ ters of gene@@ tic code ; it &apos;s the largest molec@@ ule ever made by humans of a defin@@ ed structure .
It &apos;s over 300 million molec@@ ular wei@@ ght .
If we prin@@ ted it out at a 10 f@@ on@@ t with no spac@@ ing , it takes 1@@ 4@@ 2 p@@ ages just to pr@@ int this gene@@ tic code .
Well , how do we bo@@ ot up a ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome ? How do we ac@@ tiv@@ ate this ?
Ob@@ vi@@ ously , with a virus it &apos;s pretty simple ; it &apos;s much more complic@@ ated de@@ aling with bacteria .
It &apos;s also sim@@ pl@@ er when you go into eu@@ kar@@ y@@ ot@@ es like ourselves : you can just po@@ p out the nu@@ cle@@ us and po@@ p in another one , and that &apos;s what you &apos;ve all heard about with cl@@ on@@ ing .
With bacteria and Ar@@ cha@@ e@@ a , the ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome is inte@@ gr@@ ated into the cell , but we recently showed that we can do a comple@@ te transp@@ l@@ ant of a ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome from one cell to another and ac@@ tiv@@ ate it .
We pu@@ ri@@ fied a ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome from one micro@@ bi@@ al species -- r@@ ough@@ ly , these two are as dist@@ ant as human and mi@@ ce -- we ad@@ ded a few ex@@ tra gen@@ es so we could sel@@ ect for this ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome , we di@@ ges@@ ted it with enz@@ ym@@ es to k@@ ill all the prot@@ eins , and it was pretty st@@ un@@ ning when we put this in the cell -- and you &apos;ll app@@ reci@@ ate our very s@@ op@@ h@@ is@@ tic@@ ated grap@@ hi@@ cs here .
The new ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome went into the cell .
In fact , we thought this might be as far as it went , but we tried to design the process a little bit further .
This is a major mechan@@ ism of evolution right here .
We find all kinds of species that have taken up a second ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome or a third one from somewhere , ad@@ ding thousands of new tra@@ its in a second to that species .
So , people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have mis@@ sed much of biology .
There are enz@@ ym@@ es called res@@ tri@@ ction enz@@ ym@@ es that actually di@@ gest DNA .
The ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome that was in the cell doesn &apos;t have one ; the ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome we put in does .
It got ex@@ pres@@ sed and it recogni@@ zed the other ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome as for@@ eig@@ n material , che@@ wed it up , and so we ended up just with a cell with the new ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ ome .
It turned blue because of the gen@@ es we put in it .
And with a very short period of time , all the charac@@ ter@@ is@@ tics of one species were lost and it conver@@ ted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell .
All the prot@@ eins changed , the mem@@ bran@@ es changed ; when we read the gene@@ tic code , it &apos;s exactly what we had trans@@ fer@@ red in .
So , this may sound like genom@@ ic al@@ chem@@ y , but we can , by moving the software of DNA around , change things quite drama@@ tically .
Now I &apos;ve ar@@ gu@@ ed , this is not gen@@ es@@ is ; this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution .
And I &apos;ve ar@@ gu@@ ed that we &apos;re about to perhaps create a new version of the Cam@@ bri@@ an expl@@ osi@@ on , where there &apos;s massive new speci@@ ation based on this digital design .
Why do this ?
I think this is pretty obvi@@ ous in terms of some of the needs .
We &apos;re about to go from six and a half to nine billion people over the next 40 years .
To put it in context for myself : I was born in 19@@ 4@@ 6 .
There are now three people on the planet for every one of us that exis@@ ted in 19@@ 4@@ 6 ; within 40 years , there &apos;ll be four .
We have trou@@ ble fe@@ e@@ ding , provi@@ ding fres@@ h , cle@@ an water , medic@@ ines , fu@@ el for the six and a half billion .
It &apos;s going to be a stre@@ t@@ ch to do it for nine .
We use over five billion t@@ ons of co@@ al , 30 billi@@ on-@@ pl@@ us bar@@ rel@@ s of oil -- that &apos;s a hundred million bar@@ rel@@ s a day .
When we try to think of bi@@ ological process@@ es or any process to re@@ place that , it &apos;s going to be a huge challenge .
Then of course , there &apos;s all that CO2 from this material that ends up in the atmosphere .
We now , from our disco@@ very around the world , have a dat@@ ab@@ ase with about 20 million gen@@ es , and I like to think of these as the design comp@@ on@@ ents of the future .
The elec@@ tron@@ ics industry only had a do@@ zen or so comp@@ on@@ ents , and look at the diversity that came out of that .
We &apos;re limit@@ ed here pri@@ mar@@ ily by a bi@@ ological reality and our imag@@ in@@ ation .
We now have techni@@ qu@@ es , because of these rap@@ id me@@ tho@@ ds of syn@@ thes@@ is , to do what we &apos;re call@@ ing com@@ bin@@ at@@ ori@@ al genom@@ ics .
We have the ability now to build a large ro@@ bot that can make a million ch@@ ro@@ mos@@ om@@ es a day .
When you think of process@@ ing these 20 million different gen@@ es or trying to op@@ ti@@ mi@@ ze process@@ es to produce oc@@ tan@@ e or to produce ph@@ ar@@ ma@@ c@@ eu@@ tic@@ als , new v@@ acc@@ ines , we can just with a small team , do more molec@@ ular biology than the last 20 years of all science .
And it &apos;s just stand@@ ard sel@@ ection : we can sel@@ ect for vi@@ ability , chem@@ ical or fu@@ el produc@@ tion , v@@ acc@@ ine produc@@ tion , etc .
This is a screen s@@ n@@ ap@@ sho@@ t of some true design software that we &apos;re working on to actually be able to sit down and design species in the computer .
You know , we don &apos;t know necess@@ arily what it &apos;ll look like : we know exactly what their gene@@ tic code looks like .
We &apos;re foc@@ using on now f@@ our@@ th@@ -@@ generation fu@@ els .
You &apos;ve seen recently , cor@@ n to eth@@ an@@ ol is just a bad experiment .
We have secon@@ d@@ - and th@@ ir@@ d-@@ generation fu@@ els that will be coming out rel@@ ativ@@ ely soon that are su@@ gar , to much high@@ er-@@ value fu@@ els like oc@@ tan@@ e or different typ@@ es of but@@ an@@ ol .
But the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without further increas@@ ing the cost of food and limit@@ ing its avail@@ ability is if we start with CO2 as its fe@@ ed@@ sto@@ ck , and so we &apos;re working with desig@@ ning cells to go down this road .
And we think we &apos;ll have the first f@@ our@@ th@@ -@@ generation fu@@ els in about 18 months .
S@@ un@@ light and CO2 is one me@@ th@@ od ...
but in our disco@@ very around the world , we have all kinds of other me@@ tho@@ ds .
This is an organ@@ ism we descri@@ bed in 199@@ 6 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about a mi@@ le and a half deep , almost at bo@@ il@@ ing@@ -@@ water temper@@ atures .
It takes CO2 to me@@ th@@ ane using molec@@ ular hydro@@ gen as its energy source .
We &apos;re looking to see if we can take cap@@ tu@@ red CO2 , which can eas@@ ily be pi@@ p@@ ed to sit@@ es , conver@@ t that CO2 back into fu@@ el to drive this process .
So , in a short period of time , we think that we might be able to incre@@ ase what the basic question is of &quot; What is life ? &quot;
We tru@@ ly , you know , have mo@@ dest go@@ als of re@@ plac@@ ing the whole p@@ et@@ ro@@ l@@ -@@ chem@@ ical industry -- Yeah . If you can &apos;t do that at TED , where can you ? -- become a major source of energy ...
But also , we &apos;re now working on using these same tools to come up with inst@@ ant s@@ ets of v@@ acc@@ ines .
You &apos;ve seen this year with flu ; we &apos;re always a year behind and a d@@ ollar short when it comes to the right v@@ acc@@ ine .
I think that can be changed by building com@@ bin@@ at@@ ori@@ al v@@ acc@@ ines in ad@@ v@@ ance .
Here &apos;s what the future may begin to look like with changing , now , the evolution@@ ary tree , spe@@ e@@ ding up evolution with syn@@ the@@ tic bacteria , Ar@@ cha@@ e@@ a and , eventually , eu@@ kar@@ y@@ ot@@ es .
We &apos;re a ways away from impro@@ ving people : our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survi@@ ve long enough to maybe do that . Thank you very much .
What I &apos;m going to show you first , as quickly as I can , is some fo@@ un@@ da@@ tional work , some new technology that we brought to M@@ ic@@ ros@@ oft as part of an ac@@ qu@@ isi@@ tion almost exactly a year ago .
This is Se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on , and it &apos;s an environment in which you can either lo@@ cally or re@@ mot@@ ely inter@@ act with v@@ ast amoun@@ ts of visual data .
We &apos;re looking at many , many gi@@ gab@@ y@@ tes of digital phot@@ os here and kind of se@@ am@@ less@@ ly and continu@@ ously zo@@ om@@ ing in , pan@@ ning through it , re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ging it in any way we want .
And it doesn &apos;t matter how much information we &apos;re looking at , how big these collec@@ tions are or how big the images are .
Most of them are ordinary digital camera phot@@ os , but this one , for example , is a s@@ can from the Li@@ br@@ ary of Con@@ gress , and it &apos;s in the 300 me@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el range .
It doesn &apos;t make any difference because the only thing that ought to li@@ mit the per@@ forman@@ ce of a system like this one is the number of pi@@ x@@ els on your screen at any given moment .
It &apos;s also very fle@@ xi@@ ble architecture .
This is an entire book , so this is an example of non-@@ image data .
This is &quot; B@@ lea@@ k H@@ ouse &quot; by Di@@ ck@@ ens . Every col@@ um@@ n is a ch@@ ap@@ ter .
To pro@@ ve to you that it &apos;s really text , and not an image , we can do something like so , to really show that this is a real repres@@ entation of the text ; it &apos;s not a picture .
Maybe this is an arti@@ f@@ ici@@ al way to read an e-@@ book .
I wouldn &apos;t re@@ comm@@ end it .
This is a more re@@ alis@@ tic case , an issue of The Gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an .
Every large image is the beginning of a sec@@ tion .
And this really gives you the jo@@ y and the good experience of read@@ ing the real paper version of a ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ine or a new@@ sp@@ aper , which is an in@@ her@@ ently multi@@ -@@ scale kind of medi@@ um .
We &apos;ve done something with the cor@@ ner of this particular issue of The Gu@@ ar@@ di@@ an .
We &apos;ve made up a fa@@ ke ad that &apos;s very high res@@ ol@@ ution -- much higher than in an ordinary ad -- and we &apos;ve em@@ be@@ d@@ ded ex@@ tra cont@@ ent .
If you want to see the fe@@ atures of this car , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even techni@@ cal speci@@ fic@@ ations .
And this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those limit@@ s on screen real es@@ ta@@ te .
We hope that this means no more pop@@ -@@ u@@ ps and other ru@@ b@@ bis@@ h like that -- sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be necess@@ ary .
Of course , m@@ app@@ ing is one of those obvi@@ ous app@@ lic@@ ations for a technology like this .
And this one I really won &apos;t spend any time on , except to say that we have things to con@@ tribu@@ te to this field as well .
But those are all the ro@@ ads in the U.@@ S .
super@@ im@@ pos@@ ed on top of a NASA ge@@ os@@ pati@@ al image .
So let &apos;s p@@ ull up , now , something else .
This is actually live on the Web now ; you can go ch@@ eck it out .
This is a project called Ph@@ ot@@ os@@ yn@@ th , which mar@@ ries two different technologies .
One of them is Se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on and the other is some very beautiful compu@@ ter@@ -@@ vision research done by No@@ ah S@@ n@@ av@@ ely , a gradu@@ ate student at the University of Washington , co@@ -@@ ad@@ vis@@ ed by Ste@@ ve S@@ ei@@ t@@ z at U.@@ W .
and R@@ ick S@@ ze@@ li@@ sk@@ i at M@@ ic@@ ros@@ oft Res@@ ear@@ ch . A very nice coll@@ abor@@ ation .
And so this is live on the Web . It &apos;s power@@ ed by Se@@ ad@@ ra@@ g@@ on .
You can see that when we do these sorts of vie@@ ws , where we can di@@ ve through images and have this kind of multi@@ -@@ res@@ ol@@ ution experience .
But the sp@@ ati@@ al ar@@ ran@@ gement of the images here is actually mean@@ ing@@ ful .
The computer vision al@@ g@@ ori@@ th@@ ms have reg@@ is@@ ter@@ ed these images together so that they cor@@ respon@@ d to the real space in which these sh@@ ots -- all taken ne@@ ar Gr@@ ass@@ i L@@ ak@@ es in the Can@@ a@@ di@@ an Ro@@ ck@@ ies -- all these sh@@ ots were taken . So you see el@@ ements here of st@@ abili@@ zed sli@@ de@@ -@@ show or pan@@ or@@ am@@ ic ima@@ ging , and these things have all been rel@@ ated sp@@ ati@@ ally .
I &apos;m not sure if I have time to show you any other environ@@ ments .
Some are much more sp@@ ati@@ al .
I would like to j@@ ump stra@@ ight to one of No@@ ah &apos;s origin@@ al dat@@ a-@@ s@@ ets -- this is from an early prot@@ ot@@ yp@@ e that we first got working this sum@@ mer -- to show you what I think is really the p@@ unch line behind the Ph@@ ot@@ os@@ yn@@ th technology , It &apos;s not necess@@ arily so ap@@ par@@ ent from looking at the environ@@ ments we &apos;ve put up on the we@@ bsite .
We had to wor@@ ry about the la@@ w@@ y@@ ers and so on .
This is a re@@ construc@@ tion of N@@ ot@@ re D@@ ame C@@ a@@ the@@ dra@@ l that was done enti@@ r@@ ely comput@@ ation@@ ally from images sc@@ rap@@ ed from F@@ li@@ ck@@ r .
You just type N@@ ot@@ re D@@ ame into F@@ li@@ ck@@ r , and you get some pictures of guys in T@@ -@@ shi@@ r@@ ts , and of the c@@ amp@@ us and so on .
And each of these or@@ ange con@@ es repres@@ ents an image that was discovered to bel@@ ong to this model .
And so these are all F@@ li@@ ck@@ r images , and they &apos;ve all been rel@@ ated sp@@ ati@@ ally in this way .
We can just n@@ avi@@ g@@ ate in this very simple way .
You know , I never thought that I &apos;d end up working at M@@ ic@@ ros@@ oft .
It &apos;s very gra@@ ti@@ f@@ ying to have this kind of rec@@ ep@@ tion here .
I guess you can see this is lots of different typ@@ es of c@@ ameras : it &apos;s everything from c@@ ell@@ -@@ phone c@@ ameras to profession@@ al S@@ L@@ R@@ s , quite a large number of them , sti@@ t@@ ched together in this environment .
If I can find some of the sort of wei@@ r@@ d ones -- So many of them are occ@@ lu@@ ded by fac@@ es , and so on .
Some@@ where in here there is actually a series of photograp@@ h@@ s -- here we go .
This is actually a pos@@ ter of N@@ ot@@ re D@@ ame that reg@@ is@@ ter@@ ed cor@@ rec@@ tly .
We can di@@ ve in from the pos@@ ter to a physical view of this environment .
What the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment .
This is now taking data from everybody -- from the entire collec@@ tive mem@@ ory , visu@@ ally , of what the Earth looks like -- and lin@@ k all of that together .
Those phot@@ os become lin@@ ked , and they make something em@@ erg@@ ent that &apos;s gre@@ ater than the s@@ um of the parts .
You have a model that em@@ erg@@ es of the entire Earth .
Th@@ ink of this as the long tail to Ste@@ ph@@ en La@@ w@@ ler &apos;s Vir@@ tual Earth work .
And this is something that gro@@ ws in comple@@ x@@ ity as people use it , and wh@@ ose benef@@ its become gre@@ ater to the us@@ ers as they use it .
Th@@ ei@@ r own phot@@ os are getting ta@@ g@@ ged with met@@ a-@@ data that somebody else enter@@ ed .
If somebody bo@@ ther@@ ed to tag all of these sa@@ in@@ ts and say who they all are , then my ph@@ o@@ to of N@@ ot@@ re D@@ ame C@@ a@@ the@@ dra@@ l sud@@ denly gets en@@ ri@@ ched with all of that data , and I can use it as an ent@@ ry point to di@@ ve into that space , into that met@@ a-@@ verse , using everybody else &apos;s phot@@ os , and do a kind of a c@@ ros@@ s-@@ mod@@ al and c@@ ros@@ s-@@ us@@ er social experience that way .
And of course , a b@@ y-@@ product of all of that is im@@ men@@ sel@@ y rich vir@@ tual models of every interesting part of the Earth , collec@@ ted not just from over@@ head fli@@ ghts and from sat@@ elli@@ te images and so on , but from the collec@@ tive mem@@ ory .
Thank you so much .
Chris Anderson : Do I understand this right ? What your software is going to allow , is that at some point , really within the next few years , all the pictures that are shar@@ ed by anyone across the world are going to lin@@ k together ?
B@@ A@@ A : Yes . What this is really doing is disco@@ ver@@ ing , creating hy@@ per@@ links , if you will , between images .
It &apos;s doing that based on the cont@@ ent inside the images .
And that gets really exciting when you think about the ri@@ chn@@ ess of the s@@ em@@ an@@ tic information a lot of images have .
Like when you do a we@@ b sear@@ ch for images , you type in p@@ hr@@ ases , and the text on the we@@ b page is car@@ r@@ ying a lot of information about what that picture is of .
What if that picture links to all of your pictures ?
The amount of s@@ em@@ an@@ tic inter@@ connec@@ tion and ri@@ chn@@ ess that comes out of that is really huge .
It &apos;s a cl@@ assi@@ c network effect .
CA : T@@ ru@@ ly incredible . Con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ations .
You know , one of the inten@@ se pleas@@ ures of tra@@ vel and one of the deli@@ ghts of eth@@ no@@ grap@@ hic research is the opportunity to live am@@ on@@ gst those who have not for@@ got@@ ten the old ways , who still feel their past in the wind , tou@@ ch it in st@@ ones poli@@ shed by ra@@ in , ta@@ ste it in the bit@@ ter lea@@ ves of plants .
Just to know that J@@ ag@@ u@@ ar sh@@ am@@ ans still journey beyond the Mil@@ k@@ y W@@ ay , or the my@@ ths of the In@@ u@@ it el@@ ders still res@@ on@@ ate with meaning , or that in the H@@ im@@ ala@@ ya , the Bu@@ dd@@ h@@ ists still pur@@ su@@ e the bre@@ ath of the D@@ har@@ ma , is to really remember the cent@@ ral re@@ vel@@ ation of anth@@ rop@@ ology , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not ex@@ ist in some absol@@ ute sense , but is just one model of reality ,
the con@@ sequ@@ ence of one particular set of ad@@ ap@@ tive cho@@ ices that our lin@@ e@@ age made , al@@ beit success@@ fully , many gener@@ ations ago .
And of course , we all share the same ad@@ ap@@ tive im@@ per@@ ati@@ ves .
We &apos;re all born . We all bring our children into the world .
We go through ini@@ ti@@ ation rit@@ es .
We have to deal with the in@@ ex@@ or@@ able separ@@ ation of death , so it sh@@ ouldn &apos;t sur@@ pr@@ ise us that we all sing , we all dan@@ ce , we all have art .
But what &apos;s interesting is the uni@@ que ca@@ dence of the song , the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m of the dan@@ ce in every culture .
And whether it is the P@@ en@@ an in the for@@ ests of B@@ or@@ ne@@ o , or the V@@ oo@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes in Ha@@ it@@ i , or the war@@ ri@@ ors in the K@@ a@@ is@@ ut des@@ ert of Nor@@ th@@ ern Ken@@ ya , the C@@ ur@@ ander@@ o in the moun@@ ta@@ ins of the An@@ des , or a car@@ av@@ an@@ ser@@ a@@ i in the middle of the S@@ ah@@ ar@@ a -- this is in@@ ci@@ d@@ ent@@ ally the fel@@ low that I tra@@ vel@@ ed into the des@@ ert with a month ago -- or in@@ deed a y@@ ak her@@ der in the s@@ lo@@ p@@ es of Q@@ om@@ ol@@ ang@@ ma ,
E@@ ver@@ est , the go@@ d@@ des@@ s mother of the world .
All of these pe@@ op@@ les teach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of ori@@ ent@@ ing yourself in the Earth .
And this is an idea , if you think about it , can only fil@@ l you with hope .
Now , together the my@@ ri@@ ad cul@@ tures of the world make up a we@@ b of spi@@ ri@@ tual life and cultural life that en@@ vel@@ op@@ s the planet , and is as important to the well@@ -@@ being of the planet as in@@ deed is the bi@@ ological we@@ b of life that you know as a bi@@ osp@@ here .
And you might think of this cultural we@@ b of life as being an eth@@ n@@ osp@@ here , and you might de@@ fine the eth@@ n@@ osp@@ here as being the s@@ um total of all thou@@ ghts and dre@@ ams , my@@ ths , ideas , inspi@@ ra@@ tions , intu@@ i@@ tions brought into being by the human imag@@ in@@ ation since the da@@ wn of consci@@ ous@@ ness .
The eth@@ n@@ osp@@ here is human@@ ity &apos;s great leg@@ ac@@ y .
It &apos;s the sym@@ bo@@ l of all that we are and all that we can be as an ast@@ on@@ ish@@ ingly in@@ qu@@ isi@@ tive species .
And just as the bi@@ osp@@ here has been sever@@ ely er@@ o@@ ded , so too is the eth@@ n@@ osp@@ here -- and , if anything , at a far gre@@ ater rate .
No biolog@@ ists , for example , would d@@ are sug@@ gest that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are on the br@@ ink of ex@@ tin@@ ction because it simply is not true , and yet that -- the most ap@@ oc@@ al@@ yp@@ tic sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o in the re@@ al@@ m of bi@@ ological diversity -- sc@@ ar@@ c@@ ely appro@@ ach@@ es what we know to be the most op@@ tim@@ is@@ tic sc@@ en@@ ari@@ o in the re@@ al@@ m of cultural diversity .
And the great in@@ dic@@ ator of that , of course , is language loss .
When each of you in this room were born , there were 6@@ ,000 langu@@ ages spo@@ ken on the planet .
Now , a language is not just a body of v@@ oc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary or a set of gra@@ m@@ ma@@ tical rules .
A language is a fl@@ ash of the human spir@@ it .
It &apos;s a v@@ eh@@ ic@@ le through which the sou@@ l of each particular culture comes into the material world .
Every language is an ol@@ d-@@ growth forest of the mind , a wat@@ er@@ shed , a thought , an ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem of spi@@ ri@@ tual possi@@ bili@@ ties .
And of those 6@@ ,000 langu@@ ages , as we sit here today in Mon@@ ter@@ ey , fully half are no longer being wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed into the ear@@ s of children .
They &apos;re no longer being taught to bab@@ ies , which means , effec@@ tively , un@@ less something changes , they &apos;re already dead .
What could be more lon@@ ely than to be en@@ vel@@ op@@ ed in sil@@ ence , to be the last of your people to speak your language , to have no way to p@@ ass on the wis@@ dom of the an@@ c@@ est@@ ors or anti@@ ci@@ p@@ ate the promis@@ e of the children ?
And yet , that dre@@ ad@@ ful f@@ ate is in@@ deed the p@@ light of somebody somewhere on Earth r@@ ough@@ ly every two weeks , because every two weeks , some el@@ der dies and car@@ ries with him into the gra@@ ve the last sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ les of an an@@ ci@@ ent ton@@ gu@@ e .
And I know there &apos;s some of you who say , &quot; Well , wouldn &apos;t it be better , wouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just spo@@ ke one language ? &quot; And I say , &quot; Gre@@ at , let &apos;s make that language Yor@@ ub@@ a . Let &apos;s make it C@@ ant@@ on@@ ese .
Let &apos;s make it K@@ og@@ i . &quot;
And you &apos;ll sud@@ denly disco@@ ver what it would be like to be un@@ able to speak your own language .
And so , what I &apos;d like to do with you today is sort of take you on a journey through the eth@@ n@@ osp@@ here , a b@@ rief journey through the eth@@ n@@ osp@@ here , to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost .
Now , there are many of us who sort of for@@ get that when I say &quot; different ways of being , &quot; I really do mean different ways of being .
Ta@@ ke , for example , this child of a Bar@@ as@@ an@@ a in the Nor@@ th@@ w@@ est A@@ ma@@ z@@ on , the people of the an@@ ac@@ on@@ da who believe that my@@ th@@ ologi@@ cally they came up the mil@@ k ri@@ ver from the e@@ ast in the bel@@ ly of s@@ ac@@ red s@@ n@@ ak@@ es .
Now , this is a people who c@@ ogni@@ tively do not dist@@ ing@@ u@@ ish the color blue from the color green because the can@@ op@@ y of the he@@ av@@ ens is equ@@ ated to the can@@ op@@ y of the forest up@@ on which the people dep@@ end .
They have a cu@@ ri@@ ous language and mar@@ ri@@ age ru@@ le which is called &quot; l@@ ing@@ u@@ is@@ tic ex@@ og@@ am@@ y : &quot; you must mar@@ ry someone who spe@@ a@@ ks a different language .
And this is all ro@@ ot@@ ed in the my@@ th@@ ological past , yet the cu@@ ri@@ ous thing is in these long hous@@ es , where there are six or seven langu@@ ages spo@@ ken because of inter@@ mar@@ ri@@ age , you never hear anyone prac@@ tic@@ ing a language .
They simply listen and then begin to speak .
Or , one of the most fas@@ cin@@ ating tri@@ bes I ever lived with , the W@@ a@@ or@@ an@@ i of nor@@ the@@ ast@@ ern E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or , an ast@@ on@@ ishing people first cont@@ ac@@ ted pe@@ ac@@ efully in 19@@ 5@@ 8 .
In 19@@ 5@@ 7 , five mis@@ sion@@ ar@@ ies att@@ emp@@ ted cont@@ act and made a critical mis@@ take .
They dro@@ pped from the air 8 x 10 gl@@ os@@ s@@ y photograp@@ h@@ s of themselves in what we would say to be fri@@ end@@ ly ges@@ tures , for@@ getting that these people of the ra@@ in@@ forest had never seen anything t@@ wo@@ -@@ dimension@@ al in their lives .
They pi@@ cked up these photograp@@ h@@ s from the forest flo@@ or , tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure , found nothing , and conc@@ lu@@ ded that these were call@@ ing car@@ ds from the de@@ vi@@ l , so they sp@@ ear@@ ed the five mis@@ sion@@ ar@@ ies to death .
But the W@@ a@@ or@@ an@@ i didn &apos;t just spe@@ ar out@@ si@@ ders .
They sp@@ ear@@ ed each other .
5@@ 4 percent of their mor@@ tal@@ ity was du@@ e to them sp@@ ear@@ ing each other .
We tra@@ ced gene@@ al@@ o@@ gi@@ es back eight gener@@ ations , and we found two inst@@ an@@ ces of natural death and when we pres@@ su@@ red the people a little bit about it , they ad@@ mit@@ ted that one of the fel@@ lo@@ ws had got@@ ten so old that he died getting old , so we sp@@ ear@@ ed him any@@ way . But at the same time they had a per@@ sp@@ ic@@ aci@@ ous knowledge of the forest that was ast@@ on@@ ishing .
Th@@ ei@@ r h@@ unter@@ s could sm@@ ell animal ur@@ ine at 40 pac@@ es and tell you what species left it behind .
In the early &apos; 8@@ 0s , I had a really ast@@ on@@ ishing assi@@ gn@@ ment when I was asked by my prof@@ essor at Har@@ v@@ ard if I was interested in going down to Ha@@ it@@ i , in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ating the sec@@ re@@ t soci@@ e@@ ties which were the fo@@ un@@ dation of D@@ u@@ v@@ ali@@ er &apos;s str@@ eng@@ th and T@@ on@@ ton M@@ ac@@ ou@@ tes , and sec@@ ur@@ ing the po@@ is@@ on used to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es .
In order to make sense out of sen@@ sation , of course , I had to understand something about this remark@@ able fa@@ it@@ h of V@@ o@@ dou@@ n . And V@@ oo@@ do@@ o is not a black ma@@ gic cul@@ t .
On the con@@ tr@@ ary , it &apos;s a complex metap@@ h@@ ysi@@ cal wor@@ ld@@ view .
It &apos;s interesting .
If I asked you to name the great religi@@ ons of the world , what would you say ?
Chr@@ is@@ ti@@ an@@ ity , Isl@@ am , Bu@@ dd@@ h@@ ism , Ju@@ da@@ ism , whatever .
There &apos;s always one contin@@ ent left out , the as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion being that sub@@ -S@@ ah@@ ar@@ an Africa had no religi@@ ous belie@@ f@@ s . Well , of course , they did and V@@ oo@@ do@@ o is simply the dis@@ ti@@ ll@@ ation of these very pro@@ found religi@@ ous ideas that came over during the tra@@ gic Di@@ as@@ por@@ a of the s@@ la@@ very er@@ a .
But , what makes V@@ oo@@ do@@ o so interesting is that it &apos;s this living relationship between the living and the dead .
So , the living give bir@@ th to the spi@@ ri@@ ts .
The spi@@ ri@@ ts can be inv@@ o@@ ked from ben@@ e@@ ath the Gre@@ at W@@ ater , respon@@ ding to the r@@ hy@@ th@@ m of the dan@@ ce to mom@@ ent@@ arily dis@@ place the sou@@ l of the living , so that for that b@@ rief sh@@ ining moment , the ac@@ ol@@ y@@ te becomes the go@@ d .
That &apos;s why the V@@ oo@@ do@@ o@@ ists like to say that &quot; You white people go to ch@@ ur@@ ch and speak about God .
We dan@@ ce in the tem@@ ple and become God . &quot;
And because you are pos@@ s@@ ess@@ ed , you are taken by the spir@@ it -- how can you be har@@ m@@ ed ?
So you see these ast@@ on@@ ishing demon@@ stra@@ tions : V@@ oo@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes in a state of tr@@ ance hand@@ ling bur@@ ning em@@ bers with imp@@ unity , a rather ast@@ on@@ ishing demon@@ stra@@ tion of the ability of the mind to aff@@ ect the body that be@@ ars it when cat@@ aly@@ zed in the state of extre@@ me exc@@ it@@ ation .
Now , of all the pe@@ op@@ les that I &apos;ve ever been with , the most extraordinary are the K@@ og@@ i of the Si@@ err@@ a N@@ ev@@ ad@@ a de S@@ ant@@ a Mar@@ ta in nor@@ th@@ ern Col@@ om@@ bi@@ a .
Des@@ c@@ en@@ dan@@ ts of the an@@ ci@@ ent Ta@@ ir@@ on@@ a ci@@ vili@@ zation which once car@@ p@@ et@@ ed the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pl@@ ain of Col@@ om@@ bi@@ a , in the wa@@ ke of the con@@ qu@@ est , these people re@@ tre@@ ated into an is@@ ol@@ ated vol@@ can@@ ic massi@@ f that so@@ ars above the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pl@@ ain .
In a b@@ loo@@ d@@ sta@@ ined contin@@ ent , these people alone were never con@@ qu@@ er@@ ed by the Sp@@ an@@ ish .
To this day , they re@@ main r@@ ul@@ ed by a ri@@ tual pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od but the tra@@ ining for the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od is rather extraordinary .
The young ac@@ ol@@ y@@ tes are taken away from their famili@@ es at the age of three and four , se@@ ques@@ ter@@ ed in a sha@@ do@@ w@@ y world of dar@@ k@@ ness in st@@ one hu@@ ts at the b@@ ase of gl@@ aci@@ ers for 18 years : two n@@ in@@ e-@@ year peri@@ o@@ ds deli@@ ber@@ ately ch@@ os@@ en to m@@ im@@ ic the nine months of ges@@ tation they spend in their natural mother &apos;s wom@@ b ; now they are metap@@ hor@@ ically in the wom@@ b of the great mother .
And for this entire time , they are in@@ cul@@ tur@@ ated into the val@@ ues of their society , val@@ ues that main@@ tain the pro@@ position that their pra@@ y@@ ers and their pra@@ y@@ ers alone main@@ tain the cos@@ mi@@ c -- or we might say the ec@@ ological -- bal@@ ance .
And at the end of this amazing ini@@ ti@@ ation , one day they &apos;re sud@@ denly taken out and for the first time in their lives , at the age of 18 , they see a sun@@ rise . And in that cr@@ y@@ st@@ al moment of a@@ war@@ en@@ ess of first light as the S@@ un beg@@ ins to ba@@ the the s@@ lo@@ p@@ es of the st@@ un@@ n@@ ingly beautiful land@@ sc@@ ape , sud@@ denly everything they have learned in the ab@@ stra@@ ct is aff@@ ir@@ m@@ ed in st@@ un@@ ning gl@@ ory . And the pri@@ est st@@ ep@@ s back
and says , &quot; You see ? It &apos;s really as I &apos;ve told you .
It is that beautiful . It is y@@ ours to prot@@ ect . &quot;
They call themselves the &quot; el@@ der bro@@ thers &quot; and they say we , who are the yo@@ unger bro@@ thers , are the ones responsi@@ ble for des@@ tro@@ ying the world .
Now , this level of intu@@ ition becomes very important .
Wh@@ en@@ ever we think of indi@@ gen@@ ous people and land@@ sc@@ ape , we either inv@@ o@@ ke R@@ ous@@ se@@ au and the old can@@ ard of the &quot; no@@ ble sa@@ v@@ age , &quot; which is an idea ra@@ c@@ ist in its simp@@ lic@@ ity , or altern@@ ativ@@ ely , we inv@@ o@@ ke Th@@ ore@@ au and say these people are clos@@ er to the Earth than we are .
Well , indi@@ gen@@ ous people are nei@@ ther s@@ enti@@ mental n@@ or we@@ ak@@ en@@ ed by n@@ os@@ tal@@ gi@@ a .
There &apos;s not a lot of room for either in the mal@@ ari@@ al s@@ w@@ am@@ ps of the A@@ sm@@ at or in the ch@@ ill@@ ing win@@ ds of Ti@@ be@@ t , but they have , ne@@ ver@@ th@@ eless , through time and ri@@ tual , for@@ ged a tradi@@ tional my@@ sti@@ que of the Earth that is based not on the idea of being self-@@ consci@@ ously close to it , but on a far sub@@ t@@ ler intu@@ ition : the idea that the Earth itself can only ex@@ ist because it is brea@@ th@@ ed into being by human consci@@ ous@@ ness .
Now , what does that mean ?
It means that a young kid from the An@@ des who &apos;s ra@@ is@@ ed to believe that that moun@@ tain is an A@@ p@@ u spir@@ it that will direc@@ t his or her des@@ tiny will be a pro@@ fo@@ und@@ ly different human being and have a different relationship to that res@@ ource or that place than a young kid from Mon@@ tan@@ a ra@@ is@@ ed to believe that a moun@@ tain is a pi@@ le of ro@@ ck ready to be min@@ ed .
W@@ he@@ ther it &apos;s the abo@@ de of a spir@@ it or a pi@@ le of ore is ir@@ rel@@ ev@@ ant .
What &apos;s interesting is the metap@@ h@@ or that defin@@ es the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I was ra@@ is@@ ed in the for@@ ests of Bri@@ ti@@ sh Col@@ um@@ bi@@ a to believe those for@@ ests exis@@ ted to be cut .
That made me a different human being than my friends am@@ on@@ gst the K@@ wa@@ gi@@ ul@@ th who believe that those for@@ ests were the abo@@ de of Hu@@ x@@ wh@@ u@@ k@@ w and the C@@ ro@@ o@@ ked Be@@ ak of He@@ a@@ ven and the can@@ ni@@ b@@ al spi@@ ri@@ ts that d@@ well@@ ed at the nor@@ th end of the world , spi@@ ri@@ ts they would have to eng@@ age during their H@@ am@@ at@@ s@@ a ini@@ ti@@ ation .
Now , if you begin to look at the idea that these cul@@ tures could create different reali@@ ties , you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary disco@@ ver@@ ies . Ta@@ ke this plant here .
It &apos;s a photograp@@ h I took in the Nor@@ th@@ w@@ est A@@ ma@@ z@@ on just last A@@ pri@@ l .
This is a@@ y@@ ah@@ u@@ as@@ ca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful p@@ sy@@ cho@@ active pre@@ par@@ ation of the sh@@ am@@ an &apos;s re@@ per@@ to@@ ire .
What makes a@@ y@@ ah@@ u@@ as@@ ca fas@@ cin@@ ating is not the sh@@ e@@ er ph@@ ar@@ ma@@ col@@ o@@ gi@@ cal potential of this pre@@ par@@ ation , but the el@@ abor@@ ation of it . It &apos;s made really of two different s@@ ources : on the one hand , this w@@ oo@@ dy li@@ an@@ a which has in it a series of be@@ ta@@ -@@ carb@@ ol@@ ines , har@@ mine , har@@ mal@@ ine , mil@@ dly h@@ all@@ u@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic -- to take the v@@ ine alone is rather to have sort of blue ha@@ zy s@@ mo@@ ke dri@@ ft across your consci@@ ous@@ ness -- but it &apos;s mi@@ x@@ ed with the lea@@ ves of a s@@ hr@@ u@@ b in the co@@ ff@@ ee family
called P@@ sych@@ ot@@ ri@@ a vi@@ ri@@ d@@ is .
This plant had in it some very powerful tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ ines , very close to brain ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in , di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ ine , 5@@ -@@ me@@ tho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ ine .
If you &apos;ve ever seen the Y@@ an@@ om@@ ami blo@@ wing that s@@ nu@@ ff up their n@@ os@@ es , that sub@@ st@@ ance they make from a different set of species also con@@ ta@@ ins me@@ tho@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ ine .
To have that po@@ w@@ der blo@@ wn up your n@@ ose is rather like being sho@@ t out of a ri@@ f@@ le bar@@ re@@ l lin@@ ed with b@@ aro@@ que pain@@ t@@ ings and land@@ ing on a sea of electri@@ city . It doesn &apos;t create the dis@@ tor@@ tion of reality ; it cre@@ ates the dis@@ solution of reality .
In fact , I used to ar@@ gu@@ e with my prof@@ essor , Richard E@@ v@@ an Sh@@ ul@@ tes -- who is a man who sp@@ ar@@ ked the psych@@ e@@ deli@@ c er@@ a with his disco@@ very of the ma@@ gic mus@@ h@@ ro@@ oms in Mex@@ ic@@ o in the 19@@ 3@@ 0s -- I used to ar@@ gu@@ e that you couldn &apos;t cl@@ assi@@ fy these tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ ines as h@@ all@@ u@@ cin@@ o@@ gen@@ ic because by the time you &apos;re under the eff@@ ects there &apos;s no one home any@@ more to experience a h@@ all@@ u@@ cin@@ ation . But the thing about tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ ines is they cannot be taken or@@ ally
because they &apos;re den@@ at@@ ured by an enz@@ y@@ me found nat@@ ur@@ ally in the human gut called mon@@ o@@ am@@ ine ox@@ i@@ d@@ ase .
They can only be taken or@@ ally if taken in con@@ j@@ un@@ ction with some other chem@@ ical that den@@ atures the M@@ A@@ O .
Now , the fas@@ cin@@ ating things are that the be@@ ta@@ -@@ carb@@ ol@@ ines found within that li@@ an@@ a are M@@ A@@ O in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of the pre@@ c@@ ise sort necess@@ ary to pot@@ enti@@ ate the tr@@ yp@@ t@@ am@@ ine . So you ask yourself a question .
How , in a fl@@ or@@ a of 8@@ 0,000 species of v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar plants , do these people find these two mor@@ ph@@ ologi@@ cally un@@ rel@@ ated plants that when com@@ bin@@ ed in this way , created a kind of bio@@ chem@@ ical version of the whole being gre@@ ater than the s@@ um of the parts ?
Well , we use that great eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism , &quot; tri@@ al and er@@ ror , &quot; which is ex@@ pos@@ ed to be mean@@ ing@@ less .
But you ask the Indi@@ ans , and they say , &quot; The plants talk to us . &quot;
Well , what does that mean ?
This tri@@ be , the Co@@ f@@ an , has 17 v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ties of a@@ y@@ ah@@ u@@ as@@ ca , all of which they dist@@ ing@@ u@@ ish a great dist@@ ance in the forest , all of which are re@@ fer@@ able to our eye as one species .
And then you ask them how they est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh their ta@@ x@@ on@@ om@@ y and they say , &quot; I thought you knew something about plants .
I mean , don &apos;t you know anything ? &quot; And I said , &quot; No . &quot;
Well , it turns out you take each of the 17 v@@ ar@@ ie@@ ties in the night of a full mo@@ on , and it s@@ ings to you in a different key .
Now , that &apos;s not going to get you a Ph@@ .@@ D@@ . at Har@@ v@@ ard , but it &apos;s a lot more interesting than coun@@ ting stam@@ ens . Now -- -- the problem -- the problem is that even those of us sym@@ pa@@ the@@ tic with the p@@ light of indi@@ gen@@ ous people view them as qu@@ a@@ int and col@@ or@@ ful but somehow re@@ duc@@ ed to the mar@@ g@@ ins of history as the real world , meaning our world , mo@@ ves on .
Well , the truth is the 20@@ th century , 300 years from now , is not going to be remem@@ ber@@ ed for its war@@ s or its technologi@@ cal innov@@ ations , but rather as the er@@ a in which we stood by the massive des@@ tru@@ ction of both bi@@ ological and cultural diversity on the planet . Now , the problem isn &apos;t change .
All cul@@ tures through all time have con@@ st@@ antly been eng@@ aged in a dan@@ ce with new possi@@ bili@@ ties of life .
And the problem is not technology itself .
The Si@@ ou@@ x Indi@@ ans did not stop being Si@@ ou@@ x when they gave up the b@@ ow and ar@@ row any more than an American stopp@@ ed being an American when he gave up the hor@@ se and bu@@ g@@ g@@ y .
It &apos;s not change or technology that thre@@ at@@ ens the inte@@ gri@@ ty of the eth@@ n@@ osp@@ here . It is power , the c@@ ru@@ de face of dom@@ in@@ ation .
W@@ her@@ ever you look around the world , you disco@@ ver that these are not cul@@ tures des@@ tin@@ ed to fa@@ de away ; these are dynam@@ ic living pe@@ op@@ les being dri@@ ven out of ex@@ ist@@ ence by identi@@ fi@@ able for@@ ces that are beyond their cap@@ ac@@ ity to ad@@ ap@@ t to : whether it &apos;s the e@@ gre@@ gi@@ ous de@@ for@@ es@@ tation in the hom@@ el@@ and of the P@@ en@@ an -- a n@@ om@@ a@@ di@@ c people from S@@ ou@@ the@@ ast Asi@@ a , from S@@ ar@@ a@@ wa@@ k -- a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago ,
and now have all been re@@ duc@@ ed to serv@@ it@@ ude and pr@@ os@@ titu@@ tion on the ban@@ ks of the ri@@ vers , where you can see the ri@@ ver itself is so@@ il@@ ed with the sil@@ t that seems to be car@@ r@@ ying half of B@@ or@@ ne@@ o away to the South China Se@@ a , where the Jap@@ an@@ ese frei@@ gh@@ ters hang light in the h@@ ori@@ z@@ on ready to fil@@ l their hol@@ ds with ra@@ w lo@@ gs ri@@ pped from the forest -- or , in the case of the Y@@ an@@ om@@ ami ,
it &apos;s the disease enti@@ ties that have come in , in the wa@@ ke of the disco@@ very of g@@ old .
Or if we go into the moun@@ ta@@ ins of Ti@@ be@@ t , where I &apos;m doing a lot of research recently , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s a c@@ ru@@ de face of political dom@@ in@@ ation .
You know , gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de , the physical ex@@ tin@@ ction of a people is uni@@ vers@@ ally con@@ dem@@ ned , but eth@@ no@@ ci@@ de , the des@@ tru@@ ction of people &apos;s way of life , is not only not con@@ dem@@ ned , it &apos;s uni@@ vers@@ ally , in many quar@@ ters , c@@ ele@@ br@@ ated as part of a development strat@@ eg@@ y .
And you cannot understand the pa@@ in of Ti@@ be@@ t until you move through it at the ground level .
I once tra@@ v@@ ell@@ ed 6@@ ,000 miles from Ch@@ eng@@ du in Wes@@ tern China over@@ land through sou@@ the@@ ast@@ ern Ti@@ be@@ t to L@@ h@@ as@@ a with a young col@@ le@@ ag@@ ue , and it was only when I got to L@@ h@@ as@@ a that I under@@ stood the face behind the statisti@@ cs you hear about : 6@@ ,000 s@@ ac@@ red mon@@ um@@ ents tor@@ n ap@@ art to d@@ ust and ash@@ es , 1@@ .@@ 2 million people kill@@ ed by the c@@ ad@@ r@@ es during the C@@ ul@@ tural Revolution .
This young man &apos;s father had been as@@ cri@@ bed to the Pan@@ chen L@@ ama .
That me@@ ant he was inst@@ antly kill@@ ed at the time of the Chinese inv@@ asi@@ on .
H@@ is un@@ cle fl@@ ed with H@@ is Hol@@ iness in the Di@@ as@@ por@@ a that took the people to N@@ ep@@ al .
H@@ is mother was in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated for the cri@@ me of being we@@ al@@ thy .
He was sm@@ u@@ g@@ gl@@ ed into the j@@ a@@ il at the age of two to hi@@ de ben@@ e@@ ath her sk@@ ir@@ t ta@@ ils because she couldn &apos;t be@@ ar to be without him .
The sis@@ ter who had done that bra@@ ve deed was put into an education cam@@ p .
One day she in@@ ad@@ ver@@ t@@ ently ste@@ pped on an ar@@ m@@ band of Ma@@ o , and for that trans@@ gres@@ sion , she was given seven years of hard lab@@ or .
The pa@@ in of Ti@@ be@@ t can be impossible to be@@ ar , but the re@@ de@@ mp@@ tive spir@@ it of the people is something to beh@@ old .
And in the end , then , it really comes down to a choice : do we want to live in a mon@@ o@@ ch@@ ro@@ ma@@ tic world of mon@@ ot@@ ony or do we want to em@@ bra@@ ce a pol@@ y@@ ch@@ ro@@ ma@@ tic world of diversity ?
Mar@@ gar@@ et Me@@ ad , the great anth@@ rop@@ olog@@ ist , said , before she died , that her great@@ est fe@@ ar was that as we dri@@ f@@ ted towards this bl@@ and@@ ly am@@ or@@ ph@@ ous gen@@ eri@@ c world view not only would we see the entire range of the human imag@@ in@@ ation re@@ duc@@ ed to a more nar@@ row mod@@ ality of thought , but that we would wa@@ ke from a dre@@ am one day having for@@ got@@ ten there were even other possi@@ bili@@ ties .
And it &apos;s hum@@ bl@@ ing to remember that our species has , perhaps , been around for &#91; 1@@ 50@@ ,000 &#93; years .
The Ne@@ o@@ li@@ th@@ ic Revolution -- which gave us ag@@ ri@@ culture , at which time we suc@@ c@@ um@@ bed to the cul@@ t of the se@@ ed ; the po@@ et@@ ry of the sh@@ am@@ an was dis@@ plac@@ ed by the pr@@ ose of the pri@@ es@@ tho@@ od ; we created hier@@ ar@@ ch@@ y speci@@ ali@@ zation sur@@ pl@@ us -- is only 10@@ ,000 years ago .
The modern industri@@ al world as we know it is bar@@ ely 300 years old .
Now , that sh@@ allow history doesn &apos;t sug@@ gest to me that we have all the ans@@ wers for all of the challen@@ ges that will con@@ front us in the en@@ su@@ ing m@@ ill@@ en@@ ni@@ a .
When these my@@ ri@@ ad cul@@ tures of the world are asked the meaning of being human , they respon@@ d with 10@@ ,000 different vo@@ ices .
And it &apos;s within that song that we will all re@@ disco@@ ver the possi@@ bility of being what we are : a fully consci@@ ous species , fully a@@ ware of en@@ sur@@ ing that all pe@@ op@@ les and all gar@@ den@@ s find a way to fl@@ our@@ ish . And there are great mom@@ ents of op@@ tim@@ ism .
This is a photograp@@ h I took at the nor@@ th@@ ern ti@@ p of B@@ aff@@ in Is@@ land when I went nar@@ wh@@ al h@@ un@@ ting with some In@@ u@@ it people , and this man , O@@ la@@ y@@ u@@ k , told me a mar@@ vel@@ ous story of his grand@@ father .
The Can@@ a@@ di@@ an government has not always been kind to the In@@ u@@ it people , and during the 19@@ 5@@ 0s , to est@@ ab@@ li@@ sh our so@@ ver@@ ei@@ gn@@ ty , we for@@ ced them into s@@ ett@@ le@@ ments .
This old man &apos;s grand@@ father ref@@ used to go .
The family , f@@ ear@@ ful for his life , took away all of his we@@ ap@@ ons , all of his tools .
Now , you must understand that the In@@ u@@ it did not fe@@ ar the c@@ old ; they took advan@@ ta@@ ge of it .
The run@@ ners of their sle@@ ds were origin@@ ally made of fish wr@@ app@@ ed in c@@ ari@@ b@@ ou hi@@ de .
So , this man &apos;s grand@@ father was not in@@ ti@@ mi@@ d@@ ated by the Ar@@ c@@ tic night or the bli@@ zz@@ ard that was blo@@ wing .
He simply sli@@ pped outside , pul@@ led down his se@@ al@@ skin tr@@ ous@@ ers and def@@ ec@@ ated into his hand . And as the f@@ ec@@ es began to free@@ ze , he shap@@ ed it into the form of a b@@ la@@ de .
He put a spra@@ y of s@@ ali@@ v@@ a on the e@@ dge of the sh@@ it k@@ ni@@ fe and as it finally fro@@ ze so@@ li@@ d , he but@@ cher@@ ed a dog with it .
He sk@@ inn@@ ed the dog and impro@@ vis@@ ed a har@@ ness , took the ri@@ b@@ c@@ age of the dog and impro@@ vis@@ ed a sl@@ ed , har@@ n@@ ess@@ ed up an ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent dog , and dis@@ appe@@ ared over the ice flo@@ es , sh@@ it k@@ ni@@ fe in b@@ elt .
Talk about getting by with nothing . And this , in many ways -- -- is a sym@@ bo@@ l of the res@@ ili@@ ence of the In@@ u@@ it people and of all indi@@ gen@@ ous people around the world .
The Can@@ a@@ di@@ an government in A@@ pri@@ l of 199@@ 9 gave back to total control of the In@@ u@@ it an area of land larger than C@@ aliforni@@ a and Tex@@ as put together .
It &apos;s our new hom@@ el@@ and . It &apos;s called N@@ un@@ av@@ ut .
It &apos;s an in@@ depend@@ ent ter@@ rit@@ ory . They control all min@@ er@@ al resources .
An amazing example of how a nation@@ -@@ state can se@@ ek res@@ titu@@ tion with its people .
And finally , in the end , I think it &apos;s pretty obvi@@ ous at least to all of all us who &apos;ve tra@@ vel@@ ed in these re@@ mo@@ te re@@ ach@@ es of the planet , to realize that they &apos;re not re@@ mo@@ te at all .
They &apos;re hom@@ el@@ ands of somebody .
They repres@@ ent bran@@ ches of the human imag@@ in@@ ation that go back to the da@@ wn of time . And for all of us , the dre@@ ams of these children , like the dre@@ ams of our own children , become part of the n@@ ak@@ ed ge@@ ograp@@ hy of hope .
So , what we &apos;re trying to do at the National Ge@@ ograp@@ hic , finally , is , we believe that poli@@ tici@@ ans will never ac@@ comp@@ li@@ sh anything .
We think that pol@@ em@@ ics -- -- we think that pol@@ em@@ ics are not per@@ su@@ asi@@ ve , but we think that stor@@ y@@ telling can change the world , and so we are probably the best stor@@ y@@ telling institu@@ tion in the world . We get 35 million h@@ its on our we@@ bsite every month .
1@@ 5@@ 6 n@@ ations car@@ ry our tel@@ ev@@ ision chan@@ ne@@ l .
Our ma@@ ga@@ z@@ ines are read by millions .
And what we &apos;re doing is a series of jour@@ ne@@ ys to the eth@@ n@@ osp@@ here where we &apos;re going to take our audience to places of such cultural w@@ on@@ der that they cannot help but come away da@@ zz@@ led by what they have seen , and hop@@ efully , there@@ fore , em@@ bra@@ ce gradu@@ ally , one by one , the cent@@ ral re@@ vel@@ ation of anth@@ rop@@ ology : that this world des@@ er@@ ves to ex@@ ist in a di@@ verse way , that we can find a way to live in a tru@@ ly m@@ ul@@ tic@@ ul@@ tural , pl@@ ur@@ alis@@ tic world
where all of the wis@@ dom of all pe@@ op@@ les can con@@ tribu@@ te to our collec@@ tive well@@ -@@ being .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m going to talk to you about some stuff that &apos;s in this book of mine that I hope will res@@ on@@ ate with other things you &apos;ve already heard , and I &apos;ll try to make some connec@@ tions myself , in case you mis@@ sed them .
But I want to start with what I call the &quot; off@@ ici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma . &quot;
The off@@ ici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma of what ?
The off@@ ici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma of all Wes@@ tern industri@@ al soci@@ e@@ ties .
And the off@@ ici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma r@@ uns like this : if we are interested in ma@@ x@@ im@@ i@@ zing the wel@@ f@@ are of our ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens , the way to do that is to ma@@ x@@ im@@ i@@ ze individual free@@ dom .
The reason for this is both that free@@ dom is in and of itself good , val@@ u@@ able , wor@@ th@@ while , ess@@ ential to being human .
And because if people have free@@ dom , then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will ma@@ x@@ im@@ i@@ ze our wel@@ f@@ are , and no one has to deci@@ de on our beh@@ al@@ f .
The way to ma@@ x@@ im@@ i@@ ze free@@ dom is to ma@@ x@@ im@@ i@@ ze choice .
The more choice people have , the more free@@ dom they have , and the more free@@ dom they have , the more wel@@ f@@ are they have .
This , I think , is so deep@@ ly em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in the water supp@@ ly that it wouldn &apos;t occ@@ ur to anyone to question it .
And it &apos;s also deep@@ ly em@@ be@@ d@@ ded in our lives .
I &apos;ll give you some examples of what modern pro@@ gress has made possible for us .
This is my super@@ market . Not such a big one .
I want to say just a word about sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ sing .
17@@ 5 sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ings in my super@@ market , if you don &apos;t coun@@ t the 10 extra@@ -@@ vir@@ g@@ in o@@ live o@@ ils and 12 bal@@ sam@@ ic v@@ in@@ eg@@ ars you could buy to make a very large number of your own sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ings , in the off@@ -@@ chance that n@@ one of the 17@@ 5 the st@@ ore has on off@@ er su@@ it you .
So this is what the super@@ market is like .
And then you go to the consu@@ mer elec@@ tron@@ ics st@@ ore to set up a ster@@ e@@ o system -- spe@@ ak@@ ers , C@@ D play@@ er , t@@ ape play@@ er , t@@ un@@ er , amp@@ li@@ fi@@ er -- and in this one single consu@@ mer elec@@ tron@@ ics st@@ ore , there are that many ster@@ e@@ o systems .
We can construc@@ t si@@ x@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a-@@ hal@@ f-@@ million different ster@@ e@@ o systems out of the comp@@ on@@ ents that are on off@@ er in one st@@ ore .
You &apos;ve got to ad@@ mit that &apos;s a lot of choice .
In other dom@@ a@@ ins -- the world of communic@@ ations .
There was a time , when I was a boy , when you could get any kind of tel@@ e@@ phone service you wanted , as long as it came from M@@ a B@@ ell .
You r@@ ented your phone . You didn &apos;t buy it .
One con@@ sequ@@ ence of that , by the way , is that the phone never bro@@ ke .
And those days are gone .
We now have an almost un@@ limit@@ ed vari@@ ety of ph@@ ones , especially in the world of cell ph@@ ones .
These are cell ph@@ ones of the future .
My favor@@ ite is the middle one -- the M@@ P@@ 3 play@@ er , n@@ ose ha@@ ir tri@@ m@@ mer , and cr@@ è@@ me br@@ û@@ l@@ é@@ e tor@@ ch .
And if by some chance you haven &apos;t seen that in your st@@ ore yet , you can rest as@@ su@@ red that one day soon , you will .
And what this does is it lea@@ ds people to walk into their stor@@ es asking this question .
And do you know what the answer to this question now is ?
The answer is &quot; no . &quot;
It is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn &apos;t do too much .
So , in other as@@ p@@ ects of life that are much more signific@@ ant than bu@@ ying things , the same expl@@ osi@@ on of choice is true .
He@@ al@@ th care . It is no longer the case in the United States that you go to the doc@@ tor , and the doc@@ tor tells you what to do .
In@@ stead , you go to the doc@@ tor , and the doc@@ tor tells you , &quot; Well , we could do A , or we could do B .
A has these benef@@ its , and these ris@@ ks .
B has these benef@@ its , and these ris@@ ks . What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; Do@@ c , what should I do ? &quot;
And the do@@ c says , &quot; A has these benef@@ its and ris@@ ks , and B has these benef@@ its and ris@@ ks .
What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; If you were me , Do@@ c , what would you do ? &quot;
And the do@@ c says , &quot; But I &apos;m not you . &quot;
And the result is -- we call it &quot; patient au@@ ton@@ om@@ y , &quot; which makes it sound like a good thing , but it really is a shi@@ f@@ ting of the bur@@ den and the responsi@@ bility for dec@@ isi@@ on-@@ making from somebody who knows something -- nam@@ ely , the doc@@ tor -- to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly si@@ ck and th@@ us not in the best shape to be making dec@@ isions -- nam@@ ely , the patient .
There &apos;s enorm@@ ous mark@@ eting of pres@@ cri@@ ption dru@@ gs to people like you and me , which , if you think about it , makes no sense at all , since we can &apos;t buy them .
Why do they market to us if we can &apos;t buy them ?
The answer is that they expect us to call our doc@@ tors the next morning and ask for our pres@@ cri@@ p@@ tions to be changed .
Some@@ thing as drama@@ tic as our identi@@ ty has now become a matter of choice , as this sli@@ de is me@@ ant to in@@ dic@@ ate .
We don &apos;t in@@ her@@ it an identi@@ ty ; we get to inv@@ ent it .
And we get to re-@@ inv@@ ent ourselves as often as we like .
And that means that every day , when you wa@@ ke up in the morning , you have to deci@@ de what kind of person you want to be .
With res@@ pect to mar@@ ri@@ age and family , there was a time when the def@@ au@@ lt as@@ su@@ mp@@ tion that almost everyone had is that you got mar@@ ried as soon as you could , and then you started having kids as soon as you could .
The only real choice was who , not when , and not what you did after .
No@@ wa@@ days , everything is very much up for gr@@ ab@@ s .
I teach wonder@@ fully intelli@@ gent students , and I assi@@ g@@ n 20 percent less work than I used to .
And it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less smart , and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less di@@ li@@ gent .
It &apos;s because they are pre@@ oc@@ cu@@ pi@@ ed , asking themselves , &quot; Sh@@ ould I get mar@@ ried or not ? Sh@@ ould I get mar@@ ried now ?
Sh@@ ould I get mar@@ ried later ? Sh@@ ould I have kids first , or a car@@ e@@ er first ? &quot;
All of these are con@@ sum@@ ing questions .
And they &apos;re going to answer these questions , whether or not it means not doing all the work I assi@@ g@@ n and not getting a good gra@@ de in my cour@@ ses .
And in@@ deed they should . These are important questions to answer .
Wor@@ k -- we are bl@@ ess@@ ed , as Car@@ l was poin@@ ting out , with the technology that en@@ ab@@ les us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet -- except the R@@ and@@ ol@@ p@@ h H@@ ot@@ el .
There is one cor@@ ner , by the way , that I &apos;m not going to tell anybody about , where the Wi@@ F@@ i actually works .
I &apos;m not telling you about it because I want to use it .
So what this means , this incredible free@@ dom of choice we have with res@@ pect to work , is that we have to make a dec@@ ision , again and again and again , about whether we should or sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be working .
We can go to watch our kid play so@@ c@@ cer , and we have our cell phone on one hi@@ p , and our Bl@@ ack@@ ber@@ ry on our other hi@@ p , and our l@@ aptop , pres@@ um@@ ably , on our l@@ aps .
And even if they &apos;re all sh@@ ut off , every minute that we &apos;re wat@@ ching our kid mu@@ ti@@ late a so@@ c@@ cer game , we are also asking ourselves , &quot; Sh@@ ould I answer this cell phone call ?
Sh@@ ould I respon@@ d to this e@@ ma@@ il ? Sh@@ ould I dra@@ ft this let@@ ter ? &quot;
And even if the answer to the question is &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s certainly going to make the experience of your kid &apos;s so@@ c@@ cer game very different than it would &apos;ve been .
So everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and li@@ fest@@ y@@ le things , life is a matter of choice .
And the world we used to live in looked like this .
That is to say , there were some cho@@ ices , but not everything was a matter of choice .
And the world we now live in looks like this .
And the question is , is this good news , or bad news ?
And the answer is , &quot; yes . &quot;
We all know what &apos;s good about it , so I &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s bad about it .
All of this choice has two eff@@ ects , two neg@@ ative eff@@ ects on people .
One effect , par@@ a@@ do@@ x@@ ically , is that it produc@@ es par@@ aly@@ s@@ is , rather than li@@ ber@@ ation .
With so many op@@ tions to cho@@ ose from , people find it very difficult to cho@@ ose at all .
I &apos;ll give you one very drama@@ tic example of this : a study that was done of inv@@ est@@ ments in vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment pl@@ ans .
A col@@ le@@ ag@@ ue of mine got access to inv@@ est@@ ment rec@@ or@@ ds from V@@ an@@ gu@@ ard , the gi@@ gan@@ tic mu@@ tu@@ al@@ -@@ f@@ und company of about a million emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es and about 2@@ ,000 different wor@@ k@@ places .
And what she found is that for every 10 mu@@ tual fun@@ ds the emp@@ lo@@ yer off@@ er@@ ed , rate of par@@ tici@@ p@@ ation went down two percent .
You off@@ er 50 fun@@ ds -- 10 percent fe@@ wer emp@@ lo@@ ye@@ es par@@ tici@@ p@@ ate than if you only off@@ er five . Why ?
Because with 50 fun@@ ds to cho@@ ose from , it &apos;s so dam@@ n hard to deci@@ de which f@@ und to cho@@ ose , that you &apos;ll just put it off until tom@@ or@@ row .
And then tom@@ or@@ row , and tom@@ or@@ row , and tom@@ or@@ row , and of course tom@@ or@@ row never comes .
Un@@ der@@ stand that not only does this mean that people are going to have to eat dog food when they re@@ ti@@ re because they don &apos;t have enough money put away , it also means that making the dec@@ ision is so hard that they p@@ ass up signific@@ ant mat@@ ching money from the emp@@ lo@@ yer .
By not par@@ tici@@ p@@ ating , they are pass@@ ing up as much as 5,000 dollars a year from the emp@@ lo@@ yer , who would happ@@ ily mat@@ ch their con@@ tribu@@ tion .
So par@@ aly@@ s@@ is is a con@@ sequ@@ ence of having too many cho@@ ices .
And I think it makes the world look like this . &#91; And la@@ st@@ ly , for all e@@ tern@@ ity , Fr@@ en@@ ch , ble@@ u che@@ ese , or ran@@ ch ? &#93; You really want to get the dec@@ ision right if it &apos;s for all e@@ tern@@ ity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to pick the wrong mu@@ tual f@@ und , or the wrong sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ sing .
So that &apos;s one effect . The second effect is that even if we man@@ age to over@@ come the par@@ aly@@ s@@ is and make a choice , we end up less sa@@ tis@@ fied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fe@@ wer op@@ tions to cho@@ ose from .
And there are several reasons for this .
is that with a lot of different sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ s@@ ings to cho@@ ose from , if you buy one , and it &apos;s not perfect -- and what sal@@ ad d@@ res@@ sing is ? -- it &apos;s easy to imagine you could have made a different choice that would have been better . And what happens is this imag@@ ined altern@@ ative in@@ duc@@ es you to re@@ gre@@ t the dec@@ ision you made , and this re@@ gre@@ t sub@@ tra@@ c@@ ts from the sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ tion you get out of the dec@@ ision you made ,
even if it was a good dec@@ ision .
The more op@@ tions there are , the eas@@ ier it is to re@@ gre@@ t anything at all that is dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting about the op@@ tion that you ch@@ ose .
Second , what econom@@ ists call &quot; opportunity cos@@ ts . &quot;
Dan G@@ il@@ bert made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things dep@@ ends on what we comp@@ are them to .
Well , when there are lots of altern@@ ati@@ ves to consi@@ der , it is easy to imagine the at@@ tra@@ c@@ tive fe@@ atures of altern@@ ati@@ ves that you re@@ ject that make you less sa@@ tis@@ fied with the altern@@ ative that you &apos;ve ch@@ os@@ en .
Here &apos;s an example . &#91; I can &apos;t stop thinking about those other available par@@ king spac@@ es on W 8@@ 5@@ th street &#93; Sor@@ ry if you &apos;re not New Yor@@ kers .
Here &apos;s what you &apos;re supposed to be thinking .
Here &apos;s this couple on the H@@ amp@@ t@@ ons .
Ver@@ y exp@@ ensive real es@@ ta@@ te .
G@@ or@@ ge@@ ous be@@ ach . Be@@ au@@ ti@@ ful day . They have it all to themselves .
What could be better ?
&quot; Well , dam@@ n it , &quot; this guy is thinking , &quot; It &apos;s Au@@ g@@ ust . Every@@ body in my Man@@ hat@@ t@@ an neigh@@ bor@@ hood is away .
I could be par@@ king right in front of my building . &quot;
And he sp@@ ends two weeks n@@ ag@@ ged by the idea that he is mis@@ sing the opportunity , day after day , to have a great par@@ king space .
sub@@ tra@@ ct from the sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ tion we get out of what we cho@@ ose , even when what we cho@@ ose is terri@@ fic .
And the more op@@ tions there are to consi@@ der , the more at@@ tra@@ c@@ tive fe@@ atures of these op@@ tions are going to be ref@@ lec@@ ted by us as opportunity cos@@ ts .
Here &apos;s another example .
Now this car@@ to@@ on makes a lot of points .
It makes points about living in the moment as well , and probably about doing things s@@ low@@ ly .
But one point it makes is that wh@@ en@@ ever you &apos;re cho@@ os@@ ing one thing , you &apos;re cho@@ os@@ ing not to do other things that may have lots of at@@ tra@@ c@@ tive fe@@ atures , and it &apos;s going to make what you &apos;re doing less at@@ tra@@ c@@ tive .
Th@@ ird : es@@ cal@@ ation of exp@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions .
This hit me when I went to re@@ place my je@@ ans .
I we@@ ar je@@ ans almost all the time .
There was a time when je@@ ans came in one f@@ la@@ vor , and you b@@ ought them , and they f@@ it like cra@@ p , they were incredibly un@@ com@@ fort@@ able , if you wor@@ e them and w@@ ash@@ ed them enough times , they started to feel OK .
I went to re@@ place my je@@ ans after years of we@@ ar@@ ing these old ones , and I said , &quot; I want a pa@@ ir of je@@ ans . Here &apos;s my size . &quot;
And the sh@@ op@@ ke@@ ep@@ er said , &quot; Do you want sli@@ m f@@ it , easy f@@ it , rel@@ a@@ x@@ ed f@@ it ?
You want but@@ ton fly or zi@@ pp@@ er fly ? You want st@@ on@@ e@@ w@@ ash@@ ed or aci@@ d-@@ w@@ ash@@ ed ?
Do you want them dis@@ tr@@ ess@@ ed ?
You want bo@@ ot cut , t@@ ap@@ er@@ ed , b@@ la@@ h b@@ la@@ h . &quot; On and on he went .
My j@@ a@@ w dro@@ pped . And after I re@@ co@@ vered , I said , &quot; I want the kind that used to be the only kind . &quot;
He had no idea what that was , so I spent an hour trying on all these dam@@ n je@@ ans , and I wal@@ ked out of the st@@ ore -- truth ! -- with the best@@ -@@ f@@ it@@ ting je@@ ans I had ever had .
I did better . All this choice made it possible for me to do better .
But -- I felt wor@@ se .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself .
The reason I felt wor@@ se is that , with all of these op@@ tions available , my exp@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions about how good a pa@@ ir of je@@ ans should be went up .
I had very low , no particular exp@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions when they only came in one f@@ la@@ vor .
When they came in 100 f@@ la@@ vor@@ s , dam@@ n it , one of them should &apos;ve been perfect .
And what I got was good , but it wasn &apos;t perfect .
And so I compar@@ ed what I got to what I exp@@ ected , and what I got was dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting in compar@@ is@@ on to what I exp@@ ected .
Ad@@ ding op@@ tions to people &apos;s lives can &apos;t help but incre@@ ase the exp@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions people have about how good those op@@ tions will be .
And what that &apos;s going to produce is less sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ tion with res@@ ults , even when they &apos;re good res@@ ults .
No@@ body in the world of mark@@ eting knows this .
&#91; It all looks so great . I can &apos;t wait to be dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted . &#93; Because if they did , you wouldn &apos;t all know what this was about .
The truth is more like this .
&#91; Every@@ thing was better back when everything was wor@@ se &#93; The reason that everything was better back when everything was wor@@ se is that when everything was wor@@ se , it was actually possible for people to have experi@@ ences that were a pleas@@ ant sur@@ pr@@ ise .
No@@ wa@@ days , the world we live in -- we aff@@ lu@@ ent , industri@@ alized ci@@ ti@@ z@@ ens , with perf@@ ection the exp@@ ec@@ tation -- the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be .
You will never be pleas@@ antly surpris@@ ed because your exp@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions , my exp@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions , have gone through the ro@@ of .
The sec@@ re@@ t to happiness -- this is what you all came for -- the sec@@ re@@ t to happiness is low exp@@ ec@@ ta@@ tions .
I want to say -- just a little au@@ to@@ bi@@ ograp@@ hi@@ cal moment -- that I actually am mar@@ ried to a wi@@ fe , and she &apos;s really quite wonderful .
I couldn &apos;t have done better . I didn &apos;t s@@ ett@@ le .
But s@@ ett@@ ling isn &apos;t always such a bad thing .
Fin@@ ally -- One con@@ sequ@@ ence of bu@@ ying a b@@ ad@@ -@@ f@@ it@@ ting pa@@ ir of je@@ ans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dis@@ sa@@ tis@@ fied , and you ask why , who &apos;s responsi@@ ble , the answer is clear : the world is responsi@@ ble .
What could you do ?
When there are hundreds of different st@@ y@@ les of je@@ ans available , and you buy one that is dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting , and you ask why , who &apos;s responsi@@ ble ?
It is equ@@ ally clear that the answer to the question is &quot; you . &quot;
You could have done better .
With a hundred different kinds of je@@ ans on dis@@ play , there is no exc@@ use for fail@@ ure .
And so when people make dec@@ isions , and even though the res@@ ults of the dec@@ isions are good , they feel dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ted about them ; they bl@@ ame themselves .
C@@ lin@@ ical de@@ pression has exp@@ lo@@ ded in the industri@@ al world in the last generation .
I believe a signific@@ ant -- not the only , but a signific@@ ant -- con@@ tri@@ but@@ or to this expl@@ osi@@ on of de@@ pression , and also su@@ ici@@ de , is that people have experi@@ ences that are dis@@ ap@@ poin@@ ting because their stand@@ ards are so high , and then when they have to explain these experi@@ ences to themselves , they think they &apos;re at f@@ au@@ lt .
And so the net result is that we do better in general , ob@@ jec@@ tively , and we feel wor@@ se .
So let me re@@ mind you .
This is the off@@ ici@@ al do@@ g@@ ma , the one that we all take to be true , and it &apos;s all fal@@ se . It is not true .
There &apos;s no question that some choice is better than n@@ one , but it doesn &apos;t follow from that that more choice is better than some choice .
There &apos;s some ma@@ gi@@ cal amount . I don &apos;t know what it is .
I &apos;m pretty con@@ fi@@ dent that we have long since pass@@ ed the point where op@@ tions impro@@ ve our wel@@ f@@ are .
Now , as a polic@@ y matter -- I &apos;m almost done -- as a polic@@ y matter , the thing to think about is this : what en@@ ab@@ les all of this choice in industri@@ al soci@@ e@@ ties is material aff@@ lu@@ ence .
There are lots of places in the world , and we have heard about several of them , where their problem is not that they have too much choice .
Th@@ ei@@ r problem is that they have too little .
So the stuff I &apos;m talking about is the pec@@ u@@ li@@ ar problem of modern , aff@@ lu@@ ent , Wes@@ tern soci@@ e@@ ties .
And what is so fru@@ str@@ ating and in@@ fu@@ ri@@ ating is this : Ste@@ ve L@@ ev@@ it@@ t talked to you y@@ es@@ ter@@ day about how these exp@@ ensive and diffic@@ ul@@ t-@@ to-@@ inst@@ all child se@@ ats don &apos;t help .
It &apos;s a wa@@ ste of money .
What I &apos;m telling you is that these exp@@ ensive , complic@@ ated cho@@ ices -- it &apos;s not simply that they don &apos;t help .
They actually h@@ urt .
They actually make us wor@@ se off .
If some of what en@@ ab@@ les people in our soci@@ e@@ ties to make all of the cho@@ ices we make were shi@@ f@@ ted to soci@@ e@@ ties in which people have too few op@@ tions , not only would those people &apos;s lives be impro@@ ved , but ours would be impro@@ ved also , which is what econom@@ ists call a &quot; Par@@ et@@ o-@@ impro@@ ving move . &quot;
In@@ come re@@ dis@@ tribu@@ tion will make everyone better off -- not just poor people -- because of how all this ex@@ cess choice pl@@ ag@@ ues us .
So to conc@@ lu@@ de . &#91; You can be anything you want to be -- no limit@@ s &#93; You &apos;re supposed to read this car@@ to@@ on , and , being a s@@ op@@ h@@ is@@ tic@@ ated person , say , &quot; A@@ h ! What does this fish know ?
You know , nothing is possible in this f@@ ish@@ bo@@ w@@ l . &quot;
Im@@ pover@@ ished imag@@ in@@ ation , a my@@ op@@ ic view of the world -- and that &apos;s the way I read it at first .
The more I thought about it , ho@@ we@@ ver , the more I came to the view that this fish knows something .
Because the truth of the matter is that if you sh@@ at@@ ter the f@@ ish@@ bo@@ w@@ l so that everything is possible , you don &apos;t have free@@ dom . You have par@@ aly@@ s@@ is .
If you sh@@ at@@ ter this f@@ ish@@ bo@@ w@@ l so that everything is possible , you de@@ cre@@ ase sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ tion .
You incre@@ ase par@@ aly@@ s@@ is , and you de@@ cre@@ ase sa@@ tis@@ fac@@ tion .
Every@@ body needs a f@@ ish@@ bo@@ w@@ l .
This one is almost certainly too limit@@ ed -- perhaps even for the fish , certainly for us .
But the ab@@ s@@ ence of some metap@@ hor@@ ical f@@ ish@@ bo@@ w@@ l is a reci@@ p@@ e for mis@@ er@@ y , and , I sus@@ pect , dis@@ a@@ ster .
Thank you very much .
